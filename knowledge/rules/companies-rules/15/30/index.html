          1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for intangible assets that are not dealt with specifically in another Standard. This Standard requires an entity to recognise an intangible asset if, and only if, specified criteria are met. The Standard also specifies how to measure the carrying amount of intangible assets and requires specified disclosures about intangible assets.

           2 This Standard shall be applied in accounting for intangible assets, except:
           <br/>

           (a) intangible assets that are within the scope of another Standard;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) financial assets, as defined in Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c) the recognition and measurement of exploration and evaluation assets (see Ind AS 106, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources); and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (d) expenditure on the development and extraction of minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.

          4 Some intangible assets may be contained in or on a physical substance such as a compact disc (in the case of computer software), legal documentation (in the case of a licence or patent) or film. In determining whether an asset that incorporates both intangible and tangible elements should be treated under Ind AS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, or as an intangible asset under this Standard, an entity uses judgement to assess which element is more significant. For example, computer software for a computer-controlled machine tool that cannot operate without that specific software is an integral part of the related hardware and it is treated as property, plant and equipment. The same applies to the operating system of a computer. When the software is not an integral part of the related hardware, computer software is treated as an intangible asset.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          5 This Standard applies to, among other things, expenditure on advertising, training, start-up, research and development activities. Research and development activities are directed to the development of knowledge. Therefore, although these activities may result in an asset with physical substance (eg a prototype), the physical element of the asset is secondary to its intangible component, ie the knowledge embodied in it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          6 In the case of a finance lease, the underlying asset may be either tangible or intangible. After initial recognition, a lessee accounts for an intangible asset held under a finance lease in accordance with this Standard. Rights under licensing agreements for items such as motion picture films, video recordings, plays, manuscripts, patents and copyrights are excluded from the scope of Ind AS 17, and are within the scope of this Standard.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          7 Exclusions from the scope of a Standard may occur if activities or transactions are so specialised that they give rise to accounting issues that may need to be dealt with in a different way. Such issues arise in the accounting for expenditure on the exploration for, or development and extraction of, oil, gas and mineral deposits in extractive industries and in the case of insurance contracts. Therefore, this Standard does not apply to expenditure on such activities and contracts. However, this Standard applies to other intangible assets used (such as computer software), and other expenditure incurred (such as start-up costs), in extractive industries or by insurers.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          7AA The amortisation method specified in this Standard does not apply to an entity that opts to amortise the intangible assets arising from service concession arrangements in respect of toll roads recognised in the financial statements for the period ending immediately before the beginning of the first Ind AS reporting period as per the exception given in paragraph D22 of Appendix D to Ind AS 101.

           Definitions
           <br/>
           <br/>
           8 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Amortisation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an intangible asset over its useful life.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           An asset is a resource:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) controlled by an entity as a result of past events; and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Carrying amount is the amount at which an asset is recognised in the balance sheet after deducting any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses thereon.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of other consideration given to acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition or construction, or, when applicable, the amount attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the specific requirements of other Indian Accounting Standards, eg Ind AS 102, Share-based Payment.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Entity-specific value is the present value of the cash flows an entity expects to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life or expects to incur when settling a liability.
           <br/>

          9 Entities frequently expend resources, or incur liabilities, on the acquisition, development, maintenance or enhancement of intangible resources such as scientific or technical knowledge, design and implementation of new processes or systems, licences, intellectual property, market knowledge and trademarks (including brand names and publishing titles). Common examples of items encompassed by these broad headings are computer software, patents, copyrights, motion picture films, customer lists, mortgage servicing rights, fishing licences, import quotas, franchises, customer or supplier relationships, customer loyalty, market share and marketing rights.

          <br/>
          10 Not all the items described in paragraph 9 meet the definition of an intangible asset, ie identifiability, control over a resource and existence of future economic benefits. If an item within the scope of this Standard does not meet the definition of an intangible asset, expenditure to acquire it or generate it internally is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. However, if the item is acquired in a business combination, it forms part of the goodwill recognised at the acquisition date (see paragraph 68).

           Identifiability
           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          11 The definition of an intangible asset requires an intangible asset to be identifiable to distinguish it from goodwill. Goodwill recognised in a business combination is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. The future economic benefits may result from synergy between the identifiable assets acquired or from assets that, individually, do not qualify for recognition in the financial statements.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
           12 An asset is identifiable if it either:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) is separable, ie is capable of being separated or divided from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability, regardless of whether the entity intends to do so; or
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.

           Control
          </b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          13 An entity controls an asset if the entity has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and to restrict the access of others to those benefits. The capacity of an entity to control the future economic benefits from an intangible asset would normally stem from legal rights that are enforceable in a court of law. In the absence of legal rights, it is more difficult to demonstrate control. However, legal enforceability of a right is not a necessary condition for control because an entity may be able to control the future economic benefits in some other way.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          14 Market and technical knowledge may give rise to future economic benefits. An entity controls those benefits if, for example, the knowledge is protected by legal rights such as copyrights, a restraint of trade agreement (where permitted) or by a legal duty on employees to maintain confidentiality.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          15 An entity may have a team of skilled staff and may be able to identify incremental staff skills leading to future economic benefits from training. The entity may also expect that the staff will continue to make their skills available to the entity. However, an entity usually has insufficient control over the expected future economic benefits arising from a team of skilled staff and from training for these items to meet the definition of an intangible asset. For a similar reason, specific management or technical talent is unlikely to meet the definition of an intangible asset, unless it is protected by legal rights to use it and to obtain the future economic benefits expected from it, and it also meets the other parts of the definition.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          16 An entity may have a portfolio of customers or a market share and expect that, because of its efforts in building customer relationships and loyalty, the customers will continue to trade with the entity. However, in the absence of legal rights to protect, or other ways to control, the relationships with customers or the loyalty of the customers to the entity, the entity usually has insufficient control over the expected economic benefits from customer relationships and loyalty for such items (eg portfolio of customers, market shares, customer relationships and customer loyalty) to meet the definition of intangible assets. In the absence of legal rights to protect customer relationships, exchange transactions for the same or similar non-contractual customer relationships (other than as part of a business combination) provide evidence that the entity is nonetheless able to control the expected future economic benefits flowing from the customer relationships. Because such exchange transactions also provide evidence that the customer relationships are separable, those customer relationships meet the definition of an intangible asset.

          <br/>
          17 The future economic benefits flowing from an intangible asset may include revenue from the sale of products or services, cost savings, or other benefits resulting from the use of the asset by the entity. For example, the use of intellectual property in a production process may reduce future production costs rather than increase future revenues.

          18 The recognition of an item as an intangible asset requires an entity to demonstrate that the item meets:
          <br/>
          (a) the definition of an intangible asset (see paragraphs 8–17); and
          <br/>
          (b) the recognition criteria (see paragraphs 21–23).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This requirement applies to costs incurred initially to acquire or internally generate an intangible asset and those incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          19 Paragraphs 25–32 deal with the application of the recognition criteria to separately acquired intangible assets, and paragraphs 33–43 deal with their application to intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Paragraph 44 deals with the initial measurement of intangible assets acquired by way of a government grant, paragraphs 45–47 with exchanges of intangible assets, and paragraphs 48–50 with the treatment of internally generated goodwill. Paragraphs 51–67 deal with the initial recognition and measurement of internally generated intangible assets.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          20 The nature of intangible assets is such that, in many cases, there are no additions to such an asset or replacements of part of it. Accordingly, most subsequent expenditures are likely to maintain the expected future economic benefits embodied in an existing intangible asset rather than meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria in this Standard. In addition, it is often difficult to attribute subsequent expenditure directly to a particular intangible asset rather than to the business as a whole. Therefore, only rarely will subsequent expenditure—expenditure incurred after the initial recognition of an acquired intangible asset or after completion of an internally generated intangible asset—be recognised in the carrying amount of an asset. Consistently with paragraph 63, subsequent expenditure on brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance (whether externally acquired or internally generated) is always recognised in profit or loss as incurred. This is because such expenditure cannot be distinguished from expenditure to develop the business as a whole.

           21 An intangible asset shall be recognised if, and only if:
           <br/>
           (a) it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and
           <br/>
           (b) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           22 An entity shall assess the probability of expected future economic benefits using reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of the set of economic conditions that will exist over the useful life of the asset.

          </b>
          <br/>
          23 An entity uses judgement to assess the degree of certainty attached to the flow of future economic benefits that are attributable to the use of the asset on the basis of the evidence available at the time of initial recognition, giving greater weight to external evidence.

          </b>
          <br/>
          25 Normally, the price an entity pays to acquire separately an intangible asset will reflect expectations about the probability that the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity. In other words, the entity expects there to be an inflow of economic benefits, even if there is uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the inflow. Therefore, the probability recognition criterion in paragraph 21(a) is always considered to be satisfied for separately acquired intangible assets.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          26 In addition, the cost of a separately acquired intangible asset can usually be measured reliably. This is particularly so when the purchase consideration is in the form of cash or other monetary assets.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          27 The cost of a separately acquired intangible asset comprises:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          28 Examples of directly attributable costs are:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) costs of employee benefits (as defined in Ind AS 19) arising directly from bringing the asset to its working condition;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) professional fees arising directly from bringing the asset to its working condition; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          29 Examples of expenditures that are not part of the cost of an intangible asset are:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising and promotional activities);
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) costs of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer (including costs of staff training); and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) administration and other general overhead costs.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          30 Recognition of costs in the carrying amount of an intangible asset ceases when the asset is in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Therefore, costs incurred in using or redeploying an intangible asset are not included in the carrying amount of that asset. For example, the following costs are not included in the carrying amount of an intangible asset:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) costs incurred while an asset capable of operating in the manner intended by management has yet to be brought into use; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) initial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the asset’s output builds up.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          31 Some operations occur in connection with the development of an intangible asset, but are not necessary to bring the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. These incidental operations may occur before or during the development activities. Because incidental operations are not necessary to bring an asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the income and related expenses of incidental operations are recognised immediately in profit or loss, and included in their respective classifications of income and expense.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          32 If payment for an intangible asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its cost is the cash price equivalent. The difference between this amount and the total payments is recognised as interest expense over the period of credit unless it is capitalised in accordance with Ind AS 23, Borrowing Costs.

          <br/>
          33 In accordance with Ind AS 103, Business Combinations, if an intangible asset is acquired in a business combination, the cost of that intangible asset is its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of an intangible asset will reflect market participants’ expectations at the acquisition date about the probability that the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity. In other words, the entity expects there to be an inflow of economic benefits, even if there is uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the inflow. Therefore, the probability recognition criterion in paragraph 21(a) is always considered to be satisfied for intangible assets acquired in business combinations. If an asset acquired in a business combination is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, sufficient information exists to measure reliably the fair value of the asset. Thus, the reliable measurement criterion in paragraph 21(b) is always considered to be satisfied for intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          34 In accordance with this Standard and Ind AS 103, an acquirer recognises at the acquisition date, separately from goodwill, an intangible asset of the acquiree, irrespective of whether the asset had been recognised by the acquiree before the business combination. This means that the acquirer recognises as an asset separately from goodwill an in-process research and development project of the acquiree if the project meets the definition of an intangible asset. An acquiree’s in-process research and development project meets the definition of an intangible asset when it:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) meets the definition of an asset; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) is identifiable, ie is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.

          <br/>
          35 If an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, sufficient information exists to measure reliably the fair value of the asset. When, for the estimates used to measure an intangible asset’s fair value, there is a range of possible outcomes with different probabilities that uncertainty enters into the measurement of the asset’s fair value.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          36 An intangible asset acquired in a business combination might be separable, but only together with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability. In such cases, the acquirer recognises the intangible asset separately from goodwill, but together with the related item.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          37 The acquirer may recognise a group of complementary intangible assets as a single asset provided the individual assets have similar useful lives. For example, the terms ‘brand’ and ‘brand name’ are often used as synonym for trademarks and other marks. However, the former are general marketing terms that are typically used to refer to a group of complimentary assets such as a trademark (or service mark) and its related trade name, formulas, recipes and technological expertise.

          45 One or more intangible assets may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The following discussion refers simply to an exchange of one non-monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding sentence. The cost of such an intangible asset is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. The acquired asset is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up. If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          46 An entity determines whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance by considering the extent to which its future cash flows are expected to change as a result of the transaction. An exchange transaction has commercial substance if:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) the configuration (ie risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received differs from the configuration of the cash flows of the asset transferred; or
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity’s operations affected by the transaction changes as a result of the exchange; and

          For the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity’s operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash flows. The result of these analyses may be clear without an entity having to perform detailed calculations.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          47 Paragraph 21(b) specifies that a condition for the recognition of an intangible asset is that the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. The fair value of an intangible asset is reliably measurable if (a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value measurements is not significant for that asset or (b) the probabilities of the various estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and used when measuring fair value. If an entity is able to measure reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given up is used to measure cost unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident.

          49 In some cases, expenditure is incurred to generate future economic benefits, but it does not result in the creation of an intangible asset that meets the recognition criteria in this Standard. Such expenditure is often described as contributing to internally generated goodwill. Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset because it is not an identifiable resource (ie it is not separable nor does it arise from contractual or other legal rights) controlled by the entity that can be measured reliably at cost.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          50 Differences between the fair value of an entity and the carrying amount of its identifiable net assets at any time may capture a range of factors that affect the fair value of the entity. However, such differences do not represent the cost of intangible assets controlled by the entity.

          </b>
          <br/>
          51 It is sometimes difficult to assess whether an internally generated intangible asset qualifies for recognition because of problems in:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) identifying whether and when there is an identifiable asset that will generate expected future economic benefits; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) determining the cost of the asset reliably. In some cases, the cost of generating an intangible asset internally cannot be distinguished from the cost of maintaining or enhancing the entity’s internally generated goodwill or of running day-to-day operations.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Therefore, in addition to complying with the general requirements for the recognition and initial measurement of an intangible asset, an entity applies the requirements and guidance in paragraphs 52–67 to all internally generated intangible assets.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          52 To assess whether an internally generated intangible asset meets the criteria for recognition, an entity classifies the generation of the asset into:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) a research phase; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) a development phase.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Although the terms ‘research’ and ‘development’ are defined, the terms ‘research phase’ and ‘development phase’ have a broader meaning for the purpose of this Standard.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          53 If an entity cannot distinguish the research phase from the development phase of an internal project to create an intangible asset, the entity treats the expenditure on that project as if it were incurred in the research phase only.

          <br/>
          55 In the research phase of an internal project, an entity cannot demonstrate that an intangible asset exists that will generate probable future economic benefits. Therefore, this expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.

           57 An intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) shall be recognised if, and only if, an entity can demonstrate all of the following:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.

          <br/>
          58 In the development phase of an internal project, an entity can, in some instances, identify an intangible asset and demonstrate that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. This is because the development phase of a project is further advanced than the research phase.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          59 Examples of development activities are:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) the design, construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) the design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies involving new technology;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) the design, construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible for commercial production; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (d) the design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          60 To demonstrate how an intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits, an entity assesses the future economic benefits to be received from the asset using the principles in Ind AS 36, Impairment of Assets. If the asset will generate economic benefits only in combination with other assets, the entity applies the concept of cash-generating units in Ind AS 36.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          61 Availability of resources to complete, use and obtain the benefits from an intangible asset can be demonstrated by, for example, a business plan showing the technical, financial and other resources needed and the entity’s ability to secure those resources. In some cases, an entity demonstrates the availability of external finance by obtaining a lender’s indication of its willingness to fund the plan.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          62 An entity’s costing systems can often measure reliably the cost of generating an intangible asset internally, such as salary and other expenditure incurred in securing copyrights or licences or developing computer software.

             An entity is developing a new         production process. During 20X5, expenditure incurred was Rs.1,000, of         which Rs.900 was incurred before 1 December 20X5 and Rs.100 was incurred         between 1 December 20X5 and 31 December 20X5. The entity is able to         demonstrate that, at 1 December 20X5, the production process met the         criteria for recognition as an intangible asset. The recoverable amount         of the know-how embodied in the process (including future cash outflows         to complete the process before it is available for use) is estimated to         be Rs.500.

             At the end of 20X5, the production process is recognised as an         intangible asset at a cost of Rs.100 (expenditure incurred since the         date when the recognition criteria were met, ie 1 December 20X5). The         Rs.900 expenditure incurred before 1 December 20X5 is recognised as an         expense because the recognition criteria were not met until 1 December         20X5.

The entity recognises an impairment         loss of Rs.200 to adjust the carrying amount of the process before         impairment loss (Rs.2,100) to its recoverable amount (Rs.1,900). This         impairment loss will be reversed in a subsequent period if the         requirements for the reversal of an impairment loss in Ind AS 36 are         met.

          69 In some cases, expenditure is incurred to provide future economic benefits to an entity, but no intangible asset or other asset is acquired or created that can be recognised. In the case of the supply of goods, the entity recognises such expenditure as an expense when it has a right to access those goods. In the case of the supply of services, the entity recognises the expenditure as an expense when it receives the services. For example, expenditure on research is recognised as an expense when it is incurred (see paragraph 54), except when it is acquired as part of a business combination. Other examples of expenditure that is recognised as an expense when it is incurred include:

For the purpose of revaluations under this Standard, fair value shall be measured by reference to an active market. Revaluations shall be made with such regularity that at the end of the reporting period the carrying amount of the asset does not differ materially from its fair value.

          78 It is uncommon for an active market to exist for an intangible asset, although this may happen. For example, in some jurisdictions, an active market may exist for freely transferable taxi licences, fishing licences or production quotas. However, an active market cannot exist for brands, newspaper mastheads, music and film publishing rights, patents or trademarks, because each such asset is unique. Also, although intangible assets are bought and sold, contracts are negotiated between individual buyers and sellers, and transactions are relatively infrequent. For these reasons, the price paid for one asset may not provide sufficient evidence of the fair value of another. Moreover, prices are often not available to the public.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          79 The frequency of revaluations depends on the volatility of the fair values of the intangible assets being revalued. If the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially from its carrying amount, a further revaluation is necessary. Some intangible assets may experience significant and volatile movements in fair value, thus necessitating annual revaluation. Such frequent revaluations are unnecessary for intangible assets with only insignificant movements in fair value.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          80 When an intangible asset is revalued, the carrying amount of that asset is adjusted to the revalued amount. At the date of the revaluation, the asset is treated in one of the following ways:

          <br/>
          (a) the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount of the asset. For example, the gross carrying amount may be restated by reference to observable market data or it may be restated proportionately to the change in the carrying amount. The accumulated amortisation at the date of the revaluation is adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount of the asset after taking into account accumulated impairment losses; or
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) the accumulated amortisation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The amount of the adjustment of accumulated amortisation forms part of the increase or decrease in the carrying amount that is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 85 and 86.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
           81 If an intangible asset in a class of revalued intangible assets cannot be revalued because there is no active market for this asset, the asset shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           82 If the fair value of a revalued intangible asset can no longer be measured by reference to an active market, the carrying amount of the asset shall be its revalued amount at the date of the last revaluation by reference to the active market less any subsequent accumulated amortisation and any subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          83 The fact that an active market no longer exists for a revalued intangible asset may indicate that the asset may be impaired and that it needs to be tested in accordance with Ind AS 36.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          84 If the fair value of the asset can be measured by reference to an active market at a subsequent measurement date, the revaluation model is applied from that date.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
           85 If an intangible asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus. However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           86 If an intangible asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset. The decrease recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.
           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          87 The cumulative revaluation surplus included in equity may be transferred directly to retained earnings when the surplus is realised. The whole surplus may be realised on the retirement or disposal of the asset. However, some of the surplus may be realised as the asset is used by the entity; in such a case, the amount of the surplus realised is the difference between amortisation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and amortisation that would have been recognised based on the asset’s historical cost. The transfer from revaluation surplus to retained earnings is not made through profit or loss.

           Useful life
           <br/>
           <br/>
           88 An entity shall assess whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite and, if finite, the length of, or number of production or similar units constituting, that useful life. An intangible asset shall be regarded by the entity as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity.
           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          89 The accounting for an intangible asset is based on its useful life. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised (see paragraphs 97–106), and an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not (see paragraphs 107–110).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          90 Many factors are considered in determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) the expected usage of the asset by the entity and whether the asset could be managed efficiently by another management team;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) typical product life cycles for the asset and public information on estimates of useful lives of similar assets that are used in a similar way;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) technical, technological, commercial or other types of obsolescence;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (d) the stability of the industry in which the asset operates and changes in the market demand for the products or services output from the asset;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (e) expected actions by competitors or potential competitors;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (f) the level of maintenance expenditure required to obtain the expected future economic benefits from the asset and the entity’s ability and intention to reach such a level;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (g) the period of control over the asset and legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of related leases; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (h) whether the useful life of the asset is dependent on the useful life of other assets of the entity.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          91 The term ‘indefinite’ does not mean ‘infinite’. The useful life of an intangible asset reflects only that level of future maintenance expenditure required to maintain the asset at its standard of performance assessed at the time of estimating the asset’s useful life, and the entity’s ability and intention to reach such a level. A conclusion that the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite should not depend on planned future expenditure in excess of that required to maintain the asset at that standard of performance.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          92 Given the history of rapid changes in technology, computer software and many other intangible assets are susceptible to technological obsolescence. Therefore, it will often be the case that their useful life is short. Expected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an intangible asset could indicate the expectation of technological or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          93 The useful life of an intangible asset may be very long or even indefinite. Uncertainty justifies estimating the useful life of an intangible asset on a prudent basis, but it does not justify choosing a life that is unrealistically short.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
           94 The useful life of an intangible asset that arises from contractual or other legal rights shall not exceed the period of the contractual or other legal rights, but may be shorter depending on the period over which the entity expects to use the asset. If the contractual or other legal rights are conveyed for a limited term that can be renewed, the useful life of the intangible asset shall include the renewal period(s) only if there is evidence to support renewal by the entity without significant cost. The useful life of a reacquired right recognised as an intangible asset in a business combination is the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted and shall not include renewal periods.
           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          95 There may be both economic and legal factors influencing the useful life of an intangible asset. Economic factors determine the period over which future economic benefits will be received by the entity. Legal factors may restrict the period over which the entity controls access to these benefits. The useful life is the shorter of the periods determined by these factors.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          96 Existence of the following factors, among others, indicates that an entity would be able to renew the contractual or other legal rights without significant cost:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) there is evidence, possibly based on experience, that the contractual or other legal rights will be renewed. If renewal is contingent upon the consent of a third party, this includes evidence that the third party will give its consent;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) there is evidence that any conditions necessary to obtain renewal will be satisfied; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) the cost to the entity of renewal is not significant when compared with the future economic benefits expected to flow to the entity from renewal.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If the cost of renewal is significant when compared with the future economic benefits expected to flow to the entity from renewal, the ‘renewal’ cost represents, in substance, the cost to acquire a new intangible asset at the renewal date.

           97 The depreciable amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life shall be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life. Amortisation shall begin when the asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Amortisation shall cease at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with Ind AS 105 and the date that the asset is derecognised. The amortisation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity. If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method shall be used. The amortisation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss unless this or another Standard permits or requires it to be included in the carrying amount of another asset.
           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          98 A variety of amortisation methods can be used to allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. These methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing balance method and the units of production method. The method used is selected on the basis of the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits embodied in the asset and is applied consistently from period to period, unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          98A There is a rebuttable presumption that an amortisation method that is based on the revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset is inappropriate. The revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset typically reflects factors that are not directly linked to the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the intangible asset. For example, revenue is affected by other inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales volumes and prices. The price component of revenue may be affected by inflation, which has no bearing upon the way in which an asset is consumed. This presumption can be overcome only in the limited circumstances:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) in which the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue, as described in paragraph 98C; or
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          98B In choosing an appropriate amortisation method in accordance with paragraph 98, an entity could determine the predominant limiting factor that is inherent in the intangible asset. For example, the contract that sets out the entity’s rights over its use of an intangible asset might specify the entity’s use of the intangible asset as a predetermined number of years (i.e. time), as a number of units produced or as a fixed total amount of revenue to be generated. Identification of such a predominant limiting factor could serve as the starting point for the identification of the appropriate basis of amortisation, but another basis may be applied if it more closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of economic benefits.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          98C In the circumstance in which the predominant limiting factor that is inherent in an intangible asset is the achievement of a revenue threshold, the revenue to be generated can be an appropriate basis for amortisation. For example, an entity could acquire a concession to explore and extract gold from a gold mine. The expiry of the contract might be based on a fixed amount of total revenue to be generated from the extraction (for example, a contract may allow the extraction of gold from the mine until total cumulative revenue from the sale of gold reaches Rs.2 billion) and not be based on time or on the amount of gold extracted. In another example, the right to operate a toll road could be based on a fixed total amount of revenue to be generated from cumulative tolls charged (for example, a contract could allow operation of the toll road until the cumulative amount of tolls generated from operating the road reaches Rs.100 million). In the case in which revenue has been established as the predominant limiting factor in the contract for the use of the intangible asset, the revenue that is to be generated might be an appropriate basis for amortising the intangible asset, provided that the contract specifies a fixed total amount of revenue to be generated on which amortisation is to be determined.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          99 Amortisation is usually recognised in profit or loss. However, sometimes the future economic benefits embodied in an asset are absorbed in producing other assets. In this case, the amortisation charge constitutes part of the cost of the other asset and is included in its carrying amount. For example, the amortisation of intangible assets used in a production process is included in the carrying amount of inventories (see Ind AS 2, Inventories).

          101 The depreciable amount of an asset with a finite useful life is determined after deducting its residual value. A residual value other than zero implies that an entity expects to dispose of the intangible asset before the end of its economic life.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          102 An estimate of an asset’s residual value is based on the amount recoverable from disposal using prices prevailing at the date of the estimate for the sale of a similar asset that has reached the end of its useful life and has operated under conditions similar to those in which the asset will be used. The residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year-end. A change in the asset’s residual value is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          103 The residual value of an intangible asset may increase to an amount equal to or greater than the asset’s carrying amount. If it does, the asset’s amortisation charge is zero unless and until its residual value subsequently decreases to an amount below the asset’s carrying amount.

If there has been a change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, the amortisation method shall be changed to reflect the changed pattern.

          <br/>
          106 Over time, the pattern of future economic benefits expected to flow to an entity from an intangible asset may change. For example, it may become apparent that a diminishing balance method of amortisation is appropriate rather than a straight-line method. Another example is if use of the rights represented by a licence is deferred pending action on other components of the business plan. In this case, economic benefits that flow from the asset may not be received until later periods.

          119 A class of intangible assets is a grouping of assets of a similar nature and use in an entity’s operations. Examples of separate classes may include:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) brand names;
          <br/>

          (f) recipes, formulae, models, designs and prototypes; and
          <br/>
          (g) intangible assets under development.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The classes mentioned above are disaggregated (aggregated) into smaller (larger) classes if this results in more relevant information for the users of the financial statements.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          120 An entity discloses information on impaired intangible assets in accordance with Ind AS 36 in addition to the information required by paragraph 118(e)(iii)–(v).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          121 Ind AS 8 requires an entity to disclose the nature and amount of a change in an accounting estimate that has a material effect in the current period or is expected to have a material effect in subsequent periods. Such disclosure may arise from changes in:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) the assessment of an intangible asset’s useful life;
          <br/>
          (b) the amortisation method; or
          <br/>
          (c) residual values.

           <br/>
           (a) for an intangible asset assessed as having an indefinite useful life, the carrying amount of that asset and the reasons supporting the assessment of an indefinite useful life. In giving these reasons, the entity shall describe the factor(s) that played a significant role in determining that the asset has an indefinite useful life.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) a description, the carrying amount and remaining amortisation period of any individual intangible asset that is material to the entity’s financial statements.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c) for intangible assets acquired by way of a government grant and initially recognised at fair value (see paragraph 44):
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (i) the fair value initially recognised for these assets;
           <br/>
           (ii) their carrying amount; and
           <br/>
           (iii) whether they are measured after recognition under the cost model or the revaluation model.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (d) the existence and carrying amounts of intangible assets whose title is restricted and the carrying amounts of intangible assets pledged as security for liabilities.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (e) the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of intangible assets.

          <br/>
          <br/>
          123 When an entity describes the factor(s) that played a significant role in determining that the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite, the entity considers the list of factors in paragraph 90.

          <b>
           124 If intangible assets are accounted for at revalued amounts, an entity shall disclose the following:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           a. by class of intangible assets:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (i) the effective date of the revaluation;
           <br/>
           (ii) the carrying amount of revalued intangible assets; and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (iii) the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the revalued class of intangible assets been measured after recognition using the cost model in paragraph 74;and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           b. the amount of the revaluation surplus that relates to intangible assets at the beginning and end of the period, indicating the changes during
           <br/>
           <br/>
           the period and any restrictions on the distribution of the balance to shareholders.

           c. [Refer Appendix 1]
          </b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          125 It may be necessary to aggregate the classes of revalued assets into larger classes for disclosure purposes. However, classes are not aggregated if this would result in the combination of a class of intangible assets that includes amounts measured under both the cost and revaluation models.

           Intangible Assets—Web Site Costs

          This appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS.

           <u>
            Issue
           </u>
          </b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          1 An entity may incur internal expenditure on the development and operation of its own web site for internal or external access. A web site designed for external access may be used for various purposes such as to promote and advertise an entity’s own products and services, provide electronic services, and sell products and services. A web site designed for internal access may be used to store company policies and customer details, and search relevant information.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          2 The stages of a web site’s development can be described as follows:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) Planning – includes undertaking feasibility studies, defining objectives and specifications, evaluating alternatives and selecting preferences.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) Application and Infrastructure Development – includes obtaining a domain name, purchasing and developing hardware and operating software, installing developed applications and stress testing.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) Graphical Design Development – includes designing the appearance of web pages.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (d) Content Development – includes creating, purchasing, preparing and uploading information, either textual or graphical in nature, on the web site before the completion of the web site’s development. This information may either be stored in separate databases that are integrated into (or accessed from) the web site or coded directly into the web pages.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          3 Once development of a web site has been completed, the Operating stage begins. During this stage, an entity maintains and enhances the applications, infrastructure, graphical design and content of the web site.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          4 When accounting for internal expenditure on the development and operation of an entity’s own web site for internal or external access, the issues are:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) whether the web site is an internally generated intangible asset that is subject to the requirements of Ind AS 38; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) the appropriate accounting treatment of such expenditure.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          5 This Appendix does not apply to expenditure on purchasing, developing, and operating hardware (eg web servers, staging servers, production servers and Internet connections) of a web site. Such expenditure is accounted for under Ind AS 16. Additionally, when an entity incurs expenditure on an Internet service provider hosting the entity’s web site, the expenditure is recognised as an expense under paragraph 88 of Ind AS 1 and the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India when the services are received.

Ind AS 38 does not apply to intangible assets held by an entity for sale in the ordinary course of business (see Ind AS 2 and Ind AS 115) or leases that fall within the scope of Ind AS 17. Accordingly, this Appendix does not apply to expenditure on the development or operation of a web site (or web site software) for sale to another entity. When a web site is leased under an operating lease, the lessor applies this Appendix. When a web site is leased under a finance lease, the lessee applies this Appendix after initial recognition of the leased asset.]

          7 An entity’s own web site that arises from development and is for internal or external access is an internally generated intangible asset that is subject to the requirements of Ind AS 38.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          8 A web site arising from development shall be recognised as an intangible asset if, and only if, in addition to complying with the general requirements described in paragraph 21 of Ind AS 38 for recognition and initial measurement, an entity can satisfy the requirements in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38. In particular, an entity may be able to satisfy the requirement to demonstrate how its web site will generate probable future economic benefits in accordance with paragraph 57 (d) of Ind AS 38 when, for example, the web site is capable of generating revenues, including direct revenues from enabling orders to be placed. An entity is not able to demonstrate how a web site developed solely or primarily for promoting and advertising its own products and services will generate probable future economic benefits, and consequently all expenditure on developing such a web site shall be recognised as an expense when incurred.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          9 Any internal expenditure on the development and operation of an entity’s own web site shall be accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 38. The nature of each activity for which expenditure is incurred (eg training employees and maintaining the web site) and the web site’s stage of development or post-development shall be evaluated to determine the appropriate accounting treatment. For example:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) the Planning stage is similar in nature to the research phase in paragraphs 54-56 of Ind AS 38. Expenditure incurred in this stage shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) the Application and Infrastructure Development stage, the Graphical Design stage and the Content Development stage, to the extent that content is developed for purposes other than to advertise and promote an entity’s own products and services, are similar in nature to the development phase in paragraphs 57-64 of Ind AS 38. Expenditure incurred in these stages shall be included in the cost of a web site recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Appendix when the expenditure can be directly attributed and is necessary to creating, producing or preparing the web site for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. For example, expenditure on purchasing or creating content (other than content that advertises and promotes an entity’s own products and services) specifically for a web site, or expenditure to enable use of the content (eg a fee for acquiring a licence to reproduce) on the web site, shall be included in the cost of development when this condition is met. However, in accordance with paragraph 71 of Ind AS 38, expenditure on an intangible item that was initially recognised as an expense in previous financial statements shall not be recognised as part of the cost of an intangible asset at a later date (eg if the costs of a copyright have been fully amortised, and the content is subsequently provided on a web site).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) expenditure incurred in the Content Development stage, to the extent that content is developed to advertise and promote an entity’s own products and services (eg digital photographs of products), shall be recognised as an expense when incurred in accordance with paragraph 69(c) of Ind AS 38. For example, when accounting for expenditure on professional services for taking digital photographs of an entity’s own products and for enhancing their display, expenditure shall be recognised as an expense as the professional services are received during the process, not when the digital photographs are displayed on the web site.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (d) the Operating stage begins once development of a web site is complete. Expenditure incurred in this stage shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria in paragraph 18 of Ind AS 38.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          10 A web site that is recognised as an intangible asset under paragraph 8 of this Appendix shall be measured after initial recognition by applying the requirements of paragraphs 72-87 of Ind AS 38. The best estimate of a web site’s useful life should be short.
