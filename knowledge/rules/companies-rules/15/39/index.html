              1 The objective of this Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) is to require entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) the significance of financial instruments for the entity’s financial position and performance; and
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the end of the reporting period, and how the entity manages those risks.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              2 The principles in this Ind AS complement the principles for recognising, measuring and presenting financial assets and financial liabilities in Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments.

             </span>
             <span class="csD9152503">
              <br/>
              3 This Ind AS shall be applied by all entities to all types of financial instruments, except:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) those interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 110, Consolidated Financial Statements, Ind AS 27, Separate Financial Statements or Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. However, in some cases, Ind AS 110, Ind AS 27 or Ind AS 28 require or permit an entity to account for an interest in a subsidiary, associate or joint venture using Ind AS 109; in those cases, entities shall apply the requirements of this Ind AS and, for those measured at fair value, the requirements of Ind AS 113 Fair Value Measurement. Entities shall also apply this Ind AS to all derivatives linked to interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures unless the derivative meets the definition of an equity instrument in Ind AS 32.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) employers’ rights and obligations arising from employee benefit plans, to which Ind AS 19, Employee Benefits, applies.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (c) [Refer Appendix 1]
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (d) insurance contracts as defined in Ind AS 104, Insurance Contracts. However, this Ind AS applies to derivatives that are embedded in insurance contracts if Ind AS 109 requires the entity to account for them separately. Moreover, an issuer shall apply this Ind AS to financial guarantee contracts if the issuer applies Ind AS 109 in recognising and measuring the contracts, but shall apply Ind AS 104 if the issuer elects, in accordance with paragraph 4(d) of Ind AS 104, to apply Ind AS 104 in recognising and measuring them.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (e) financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share-based payment transactions to which Ind AS 102, Share-based Payment, applies, except that this Ind AS applies to contracts within the scope of Ind AS 109.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (f) instruments that are required to be classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D of Ind AS 32.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              4 This Ind AS applies to recognised and unrecognised financial instruments. Recognised financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities that are within the scope of Ind AS 109. Unrecognised financial instruments include some financial instruments that, although outside the scope of Ind AS 109, are within the scope of this Ind AS.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              5 This Ind AS applies to contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that are within the scope of Ind AS 109.

              <br/>
              (a) its accounting policy for recognising in profit or loss the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price to reflect a change in factors (including time) that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability (see paragraph B5.1.2A(b) of Ind AS 109).

              35A  An entity shall apply the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 35F–35N to financial instruments to which the impairment requirements in Ind AS 109 are applied. However:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, paragraph 35J applies to those trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables on which lifetime expected credit losses are recognised in accordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of Ind AS 109, if those financial assets are modified while more than 30 days past due; and
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) paragraph 35K(b) does not apply to lease receivables.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              35B. The credit risk disclosures made in accordance with paragraphs 35F–35N shall enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of credit risk on the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows. To achieve this objective, credit risk disclosures shall provide:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) information about an entity’s credit risk management practices and how they relate to the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses, including the methods, assumptions and information used to measure expected credit losses;
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) quantitative and qualitative information that allows users of financial statements to evaluate the amounts in the financial statements arising from expected credit losses, including changes in the amount of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes; and
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (c) information about an entity’s credit risk exposure (ie the credit risk inherent in an entity’s financial assets and commitments to extend credit) including significant credit risk concentrations.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              35C. An entity need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere, provided that the information is incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to other statements, such as a management commentary or risk report that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements and at the same time. Without the information incorporated by cross-reference, the financial statements are incomplete.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              35D. To meet the objectives in paragraph 35B, an entity shall (except as otherwise specified) consider how much detail to disclose, how much emphasis to place on different aspects of the disclosure requirements, the appropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation, and whether users of financial statements need additional explanations to evaluate the quantitative information disclosed.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              35E. If the disclosures provided in accordance with paragraphs 35F–35N are insufficient to meet the objectives in paragraph 35B, an entity shall disclose additional information that is necessary to meet those objectives.

              (i) financial instruments are considered to have low credit risk in accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of Ind AS 109, including the classes of financial instruments to which it applies; and
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (ii) the presumption in paragraph 5.5.11 of Ind AS 109, that there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition when financial assets are more than 30 days past due, has been rebutted;
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) an entity’s definitions of default, including the reasons for selecting those definitions;

              <br/>
              (d) how an entity determined that financial assets are credit-impaired financial assets;

              <br/>
              (e) an entity’s write-off policy, including the indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery and information about the policy for financial assets that are written-off but are still subject to enforcement activity; and
              <br/>
              (f) how the requirements in paragraph 5.5.12 of Ind AS 109 for the modification of contractual cash flows of financial assets have been applied, including how an entity:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (i) determines whether the credit risk on a financial asset that has been modified while the loss allowance was measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, has improved to the extent that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses in accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of Ind AS 109; and
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (ii) monitors the extent to which the loss allowance on financial assets meeting the criteria in (i) is subsequently remeasured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 of Ind AS 109.

              42A. The disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42B–42H relating to transfers of financial assets supplement the other disclosure requirements of this Ind AS. An entity shall present the disclosures required by paragraphs 42B–42H in a single note in its financial statements. An entity shall provide the required disclosures for all transferred financial assets that are not derecognised and for any continuing involvement in a transferred asset, existing at the reporting date, irrespective of when the related transfer transaction occurred. For the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in those paragraphs, an entity transfers all or a part of a financial asset (the transferred financial asset) if, and only if, it either:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset; or
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              42B. An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) to understand the relationship between transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and the associated liabilities; and
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity’s continuing involvement in derecognised financial assets.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              42C. For the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42E–42H, an entity has continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if, as part of the transfer, the entity retains any of the contractual rights or obligations inherent in the transferred financial asset or obtains any new contractual rights or obligations relating to the transferred financial asset. For the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42E–42H, the following do not constitute continuing involvement:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) normal representations and warranties relating to fraudulent transfer and concepts of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealings that could invalidate a transfer as a result of legal action;
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) forward, option and other contracts to reacquire the transferred financial asset for which the contract price (or exercise price) is the fair value of the transferred financial asset; or
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (c) an arrangement whereby an entity retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more entities and the conditions in paragraph 3.2.5(a)–(c) of Ind AS 109 are met.

              <br/>
              (d) when the counterparty (counterparties) to the associated liabilities has (have) recourse only to the transferred assets, a schedule that sets out the fair value of the transferred assets, the fair value of the associated liabilities and the net position (the difference between the fair value of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities).

              <br/>
              (a) the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that are recognised in the entity’s balance sheet and represent the entity’s continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets, and the line items in which the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities are recognised.

              (d) the undiscounted cash outflows that would or may be required to repurchase derecognised financial assets (eg the strike price in an option agreement) or other amounts payable to the transferee in respect of the transferred assets.

              <br/>
              <br/>
              (e) a maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash outflows that would or may be required to repurchase the derecognised financial assets or other amounts payable to the transferee in respect of the transferred assets, showing the remaining contractual maturities of the entity’s continuing involvement.

              (b) income and expenses recognised, both in the reporting period and cumulatively, from the entity’s continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets (eg fair value changes in derivative instruments).

              <br/>
              (c) if the total amount of proceeds from transfer activity (that qualifies for derecognition) in a reporting period is not evenly distributed throughout the reporting period (eg if a substantial proportion of the total amount of transfer activity takes place in the closing days of a reporting period):
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (i) when the greatest transfer activity took place within that reporting period (eg the last five days before the end of the reporting period),

              B.1. Paragraph 6 requires an entity to group financial instruments into classes that are appropriate to the nature of the information disclosed and that take into account the characteristics of those financial instruments. The classes described in paragraph 6 are determined by the entity and are, thus, distinct from the categories of financial instruments specified in Ind AS 109 (which determine how financial instruments are measured and where changes in fair value are recognised).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              B2. In determining classes of financial instrument, an entity shall, at a minimum:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) distinguish instruments measured at amortised cost from those measured at fair value.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) treat as a separate class or classes those financial instruments outside the scope of this Ind AS.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              B3. An entity decides, in the light of its circumstances, how much detail it provides to satisfy the requirements of this Ind AS, how much emphasis it places on different aspects of the requirements and how it aggregates information to display the overall picture without combining information with different characteristics. It is necessary to strike a balance between overburdening financial statements with excessive detail that may not assist users of financial statements and obscuring important information as a result of too much aggregation. For example, an entity shall not obscure important information by including it among a large amount of insignificant detail. Similarly, an entity shall not disclose information that is so aggregated that it obscures important differences between individual transactions or associated risks.

In accordance with paragraph 5.5.9 of Ind AS 109, the determination of whether lifetime expected credit losses should be recognised is based on the increase in the risk of a default occurring since initial recognition. Information about an entity’s definitions of default that will assist users of financial statements in understanding how an entity has applied the expected credit loss requirements in Ind AS 109 may include:
              <br/>

              B8B. To assist users of financial statements in evaluating an entity’s restructuring and modification policies, paragraph 35F(f)(i) requires the disclosure of information about how an entity monitors the extent to which the loss allowance on financial assets previously disclosed in accordance with paragraph 35F(f)(i) are subsequently measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses in accordance with paragraph 5.5.3 of Ind AS 109. Quantitative information that will assist users in understanding the subsequent increase in credit risk of modified financial assets may include information about modified financial assets meeting the criteria in paragraph 35F(f)(i) for which the loss allowance has reverted to being measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (ie a deterioration rate).

Paragraph 35G(a) requires the disclosure of information about the basis of inputs and assumptions and the estimation techniques used to apply the impairment requirements in Ind AS 109. An entity’s assumptions and inputs used to measure expected credit losses or determine the extent of increases in credit risk since initial recognition may include information obtained from internal historical information or rating reports and assumptions about the expected life of financial instruments and the timing of the sale of collateral.

              B8D. In accordance with paragraph 35H, an entity is required to explain the reasons for the changes in the loss allowance during the period. In addition to the reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the loss allowance, it may be necessary to provide a narrative explanation of the changes. This narrative explanation may include an analysis of the reasons for changes in the loss allowance during the period, including:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) the portfolio composition;
              <br/>

              <br/>
              <br/>
              B8E. For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. An entity should disclose information about the changes in the loss allowance for financial assets separately from those for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. However, if a financial instrument includes both a loan (ie financial asset) and an undrawn commitment (ie loan commitment) component and the entity cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the loan commitment component from those on the financial asset component, the expected credit losses on the loan commitment should be recognised together with the loss allowance for the financial asset. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, the expected credit losses should be recognised as a provision.

Paragraph 35K requires the disclosure of information that will enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of collateral and other credit enhancements on the amount of expected credit losses. An entity is neither required to disclose information about the fair value of collateral and other credit enhancements nor is it required to quantify the exact value of the collateral that was included in the calculation of expected credit losses (ie the loss given default).

              B8H. Paragraph 35M requires the disclosure of information about an entity’s credit risk exposure and significant concentrations of credit risk at the reporting date. A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. An entity should provide information that enables users of financial statements to understand whether there are groups or portfolios of financial instruments with particular features that could affect a large portion of that group of financial instruments such as concentration to particular risks. This could include, for example, loan-to-value groupings, geographical, industry or issuer-type concentrations.

              <br/>
              B8I. The number of credit risk rating grades used to disclose the information in accordance with paragraph 35M shall be consistent with the number that the entity reports to key management personnel for credit risk management purposes. If past due information is the only borrower-specific information available and an entity uses past due information to

              <br/>
              B8J. When an entity has measured expected credit losses on a collective basis, the entity may not be able to allocate the gross carrying amount of individual financial assets or the exposure to credit risk on loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts to the credit risk rating grades for which lifetime expected credit losses are recognised. In that case, an entity should apply the requirement in paragraph 35M to those financial instruments that can be directly allocated to a credit risk rating grade and disclose separately the gross carrying amount of financial instruments for which lifetime expected credit losses have been measured on a collective basis.

              <br/>
              (a) granting loans to customers and placing deposits with other entities. In these cases, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the related financial assets.

              <br/>
              (b) entering into derivative contracts, eg foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and credit derivatives. When the resulting asset is measured at fair value, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period will equal the carrying amount.

              <br/>
              (c) granting financial guarantees. In this case, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the entity could have to pay if the guarantee is called on, which may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability.

              <br/>
              (d) making a loan commitment that is irrevocable over the life of the facility or is revocable only in response to a material adverse change. If the issuer cannot settle the loan commitment net in cash or another financial instrument, the maximum credit exposure is the full amount of the commitment. This is because it is uncertain whether the amount of any undrawn portion may be drawn upon in the future. This may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability

              B11. In preparing the maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) and (b), an entity uses its judgement to determine an appropriate number of time bands. For example, an entity might determine that the following time bands are appropriate:

              (a) not later than one month;

              B11B. Paragraph 39(b) requires an entity to disclose a quantitative maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities that shows remaining contractual maturities if the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows.

              (a) when a counterparty has a choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, financial liabilities that an entity can be required to repay on demand (eg demand deposits) are included in the earliest time band.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) when an entity is committed to make amounts available in instalments, each instalment is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, an undrawn loan commitment is included in the time band containing the earliest date it can be drawn down.

              Such undiscounted cash flows differ from the amount included in the balance sheet because the amount in balance sheet is based on discounted cash flows. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. For example, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the end of the period.

              If an entity has exposure to only one type of market risk in only one economic environment, it would not show disaggregated information.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              B18. Paragraph 40(a) requires the sensitivity analysis to show the effect on profit or loss and equity of reasonably possible changes in the relevant risk variable (eg prevailing market interest rates, currency rates, equity prices or commodity prices). For this purpose:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) entities are not required to determine what the profit or loss for the period would have been if relevant risk variables had been different. Instead, entities disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity at the end of the reporting period assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at the end of the reporting period and had been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date. For example, if an entity has a floating rate liability at the end of the year, the entity would disclose the effect on profit or loss (ie interest expense) for the current year if interest rates had varied by reasonably possible amounts.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (b) entities are not required to disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity for each change within a range of reasonably possible changes of the relevant risk variable. Disclosure of the effects of the changes at the limits of the reasonably possible range would be sufficient.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              B19. In determining what a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable is, an entity should consider:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              (a) the economic environments in which it operates. A reasonably possible change should not include remote or ‘worst case’ scenarios or ‘stress tests’. Moreover, if the rate of change in the underlying risk variable is stable, the entity need not alter the chosen reasonably possible change in the risk variable. For example, assume that interest rates are 5 per cent and an entity determines that a fluctuation in interest rates of ±50 basis points is reasonably possible. It would disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 4.5 per cent or 5.5 per cent. In the next period, interest rates have increased to 5.5 per cent. The entity continues to believe that interest rates may fluctuate by ±50 basis points (ie that the rate of change in interest rates is stable). The entity would disclose the effect on profit or loss and equity if interest rates were to change to 5 per cent or 6 per cent. The entity would not be required to revise its assessment that interest rates might reasonably fluctuate by
              <br/>
              ±50 basis points, unless there is evidence that interest rates have become significantly more volatile.

              B20. Paragraph 41 permits an entity to use a sensitivity analysis that reflects interdependencies between risk variables, such as a value-at-risk methodology, if it uses this analysis to manage its exposure to financial risks. This applies even if such a methodology measures only the potential for loss and does not measure the potential for gain. Such an entity might comply with paragraph 41(a) by disclosing the type of value-at-risk model used (eg whether the model relies on Monte Carlo simulations), an explanation about how the model works and the main assumptions (eg the holding period and confidence level). Entities might also disclose the historical observation period and weightings applied to observations within that period, an explanation of how options are dealt with in the calculations, and which volatilities and correlations (or, alternatively, Monte Carlo probability distribution simulations) are used.

To comply with paragraph 40, an entity might disclose the effect of a decrease in a specified stock market index, commodity price, or other risk variable. For example, if an entity gives residual value guarantees that are financial instruments, the entity discloses an increase or decrease in the value of the assets to which the guarantee applies.

Two examples of financial instruments that give rise to equity price risk are (a) a holding of equities in another entity and (b) an investment in a trust that in turn holds investments in equity instruments. Other examples include forward contracts and options to buy or sell specified quantities of an equity instrument and swaps that are indexed to equity prices. The fair values of such financial instruments are affected by changes in the market price of the underlying equity instruments.

For example, if a subsidiary transfers to an unrelated third party a financial asset in which the parent of the subsidiary has continuing involvement, the subsidiary does not include the parent’s involvement in the assessment of whether it has continuing involvement in the transferred asset in its separate or individual financial statements (ie when the subsidiary is the reporting entity). However, a parent would include its continuing involvement (or that of another member of the group) in a financial asset transferred by its subsidiary in determining whether it has continuing involvement in the transferred asset in its consolidated financial statements (ie when the reporting entity is the group).

The entity assesses the servicing contract in accordance with the guidance in paragraphs 42C and B30 to decide whether the entity has continuing involvement as a result of the servicing contract for the purposes of the disclosure requirements. For example, a servicer will have continuing involvement in the transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if the servicing fee is dependent on the amount or timing of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset. Similarly, a servicer has continuing involvement for the purposes of the disclosure requirements if a fixed fee would not be paid in full because of non-performance of the transferred financial asset. In these examples, the servicer has an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset. This assessment is independent of whether the fee to be received is expected to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing.];

If the gross amount of the derivative asset is larger than the gross amount of the derivative liability, the financial asset disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)) and the entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with paragraph 13C(b)). However, while the financial liability disclosure table will include the entire amount of the derivative liability (in accordance with paragraph 13C(a)), it will only include the amount of the derivative asset (in accordance with paragraph 13C(b)) that is equal to the amount of the derivative liability.

              2 Different terminology is used, as used in existing laws eg, the term ‘balance sheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’ and ‘Statement of profit and loss’ is used instead of ‘Statement of comprehensive income’. Words ‘approved for issue’ have been used instead of ‘authorised for issue’ in the context of financial statements considered for the purpose of events after the reporting period.

              3 Requirements regarding disclosure of description of gains and losses presented in the separate income statement, where separate income statement is presented, have been deleted. This change is consequential to the removal of option regarding two statement approach in Ind AS 1 as compared to IAS 1. Ind AS 1 requires that the components of profit or loss and components of other comprehensive income shall be presented as a part of the statement of profit and loss.
