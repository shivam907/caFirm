           <br/>
           1	The objective of this Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) is to specify the accounting for assets held for sale, and the presentation and disclosure of
           <i>
            discontinued operations
           </i>
           . In particular, this Ind AS requires:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a)	assets that meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale to be measured at the lower of carrying amount and
           <i>
            fair value
           </i>
           less
           <i>
            costs to sell
           </i>
           , and depreciation on such assets to cease; and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b)	assets that meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale to be presented separately in the balance sheet and the results of discontinued operations to be presented separately in the statement of profit and loss.
           <br/>
           <br/>

             Scope
             <br/>
            </u>
           </b>
           <br/>
           2	The classification and presentation requirements of this Ind AS apply to all recognised
           <i>
            non-current assets
           </i>
           <sup>
            <i>
             1
            </i>
           </sup>
           and to all
           <i>
            disposal groups
           </i>
           of an entity. The measurement requirements of this Ind AS apply to all recognised non-current assets and disposal groups (as set out in paragraph 4), except for those assets listed in paragraph 5 which shall continue to be measured in accordance with the Standard noted.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           3	Assets classified as non-current in accordance with Ind AS 1,
           <i>
            Presentation of Financial Statements
           </i>
           , shall not be reclassified as
           <i>
            current assets
           </i>
           until they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with this Ind AS. Assets of a class that an entity would normally regard as non-current that are acquired exclusively with a view to resale shall not be classified as current unless they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with this Ind AS.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           4	Sometimes an entity disposes of a group of assets, possibly with some directly associated liabilities, together in a single transaction. Such a disposal group may be a group of cash-generating units, a single cash-generating unit, or part of a
           <i>
            cash-generating unit.
           </i>
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           The group may include any assets  and  any liabilities of the entity, including current assets, current liabilities and assets excluded by paragraph 5 from the measurement requirements of this Ind  AS. If a non-current asset within the scope of the measurement requirements of this Ind AS is part of a disposal group, the measurement requirements of this Ind AS apply to the group as a whole, so that the group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The requirements for measuring the individual assets and liabilities within the disposal group are set out in paragraphs 18, 19 and 23.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5	The measurement provisions of this Ind AS
           <sup>
            3
           </sup>
           do not apply to the following assets, which are covered by the Ind ASs listed, either as individual assets or as part of a disposal group:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a)	deferred tax assets (Ind AS 12,
           <i>
            Income Taxes
           </i>
           ).
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b)	assets arising from employee benefits (Ind AS 19,
           <i>
            Employee Benefits).
           </i>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c)	financial	assets	within	the	scope	of	Ind	AS	109,
           <i>
            Financial Instruments.
           </i>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (d)	[Refer Appendix 1]
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (e)	non-current assets that are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with Ind AS 41,
           <i>
            Agriculture.
           </i>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (f)	contractual rights under insurance contracts as defined in Ind AS   104,
           <i>
            nsurance Contracts.
           </i>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5A  The classification, presentation and measurement requirements in this Ind AS applicable to a non-current asset (or disposal group) that is classified as held for sale apply also to a non-current asset (or disposal group) that is classified as held for distribution to owners acting in their capacity as owners (held for distribution to owners).
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5B      This Ind AS specifies the disclosures required in respect of non-current   assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations. Disclosures in other Ind ASs do not apply to such assets (or disposal groups) unless those Ind ASs require:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a)	specific disclosures in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations; or
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b)	disclosures about measurement of assets and liabilities within a disposal  group  that  are  not  within  the  scope  of  the   measurement requirement of Ind AS 105 and such disclosures are not already provided in the other notes to the financial statements.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Additional disclosures about non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale or discontinued operations may be necessary to comply with the general requirements of Ind AS 1, in particular paragraphs 15 and 125 of that Standard.

           </b>
           <br/>
           <b>
            6    An entity shall classify a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held  for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
            <br/>
           </b>
           <br/>
           7	For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups) and its sale must be
           <i>
            highly probable
           </i>
           . Thus, an asset (or disposal group) cannot be classified as a non-current asset (or disposal group) held for sale, if the entity intends to  sell it in a distant future.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           8	For the sale to be highly probable, the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated. Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. In addition, the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, except as permitted by paragraph 9, and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will  be withdrawn. The probability of shareholders’ approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the sale is highly probable.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           8A  An entity that is committed to a sale plan involving  loss  of  control  of a subsidiary shall classify all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary as held for sale when the criteria set out in paragraphs 6–8 are met, regardless of whether the entity will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           9	Events or circumstances may extend the period to complete the sale beyond one year. An extension of the period required to complete a sale does not preclude an asset (or disposal group) from being classified as held for sale if the delay is caused by events or circumstances beyond the entity’s control and there is sufficient evidence that the entity remains committed to its plan to sell the asset (or disposal group). This will be the case when the criteria in Appendix B are met.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           10	Sale transactions include exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange has commercial substance in accordance with Ind AS 16,
           <i>
            Property, Plant and Equipment.
           </i>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           11	When an entity acquires a non-current asset (or disposal group) exclusively with a view to its subsequent disposal, it shall classify the non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale at the acquisition date only if the one-year requirement in paragraph 8 is met (except as permitted by paragraph 9) and it is highly probable that any other criteria in paragraphs 7 and 8 that are not met at that date will be met within a short period following the acquisition (usually within three months).
           <br/>
           <br/>
           12	If the criteria in paragraphs 7 and 8 are met after the reporting period, an entity shall not classify a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale in those financial statements when issued. However, when those criteria are met after the reporting period but before the approval of the financial statements for issue, the entity shall disclose the information specified in paragraph 41(a),
           <br/>
           (b) and (d) in the notes.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           12A  A non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for distribution to owners when the entity is committed to distribute the asset (or disposal group) to the owners. For this to be the case, the assets must be available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution must be highly probable. For the distribution to be highly probable, actions to complete the distribution must have been initiated and should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Actions required to complete the distribution should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the distribution will be made or that the distribution will be withdrawn. The probability of shareholders’ approval (if required in the jurisdiction) should be considered as part of the assessment of whether the distribution is highly probable.

            Extension of the period required to complete a sale
            <br/>
           </b>
           <br/>
           B1 As noted in paragraph 9, an extension of the period required to complete a sale does not preclude an asset (or disposal group) from being classified as held for sale if the delay is caused by events or circumstances beyond the entity’s control and there is sufficient evidence that the entity remains committed to its plan to sell the asset (or disposal group). An exception to the one-year requirement in paragraph 8 shall therefore apply in the following situations in which such events or circumstances arise:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a)	at the date an entity commits itself to a plan to sell a non-current asset (or disposal group) it reasonably expects that others (not a buyer) will impose conditions on the transfer of the asset (or disposal group) that will extend the period required to complete the sale, and:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (i)	actions necessary to respond to those conditions cannot be initiated until after a
           <i>
            firm purchase commitment
           </i>
           is  obtained, and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (ii)	a firm purchase commitment is highly probable within  one year.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b)	an entity obtains a firm purchase commitment and, as a result, a buyer or others unexpectedly impose conditions on the transfer of a non- current asset (or disposal group) previously classified as held for sale that will extend the period required to complete the sale, and:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (i)	timely actions necessary to respond to the conditions have been taken, and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (ii)	a favourable resolution of the delaying factors is expected.
           <br/>
           (c)	during the initial one-year period, circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and, as a result, a non-current asset (or disposal group) previously classified as held for sale is not sold by the end of that period, and:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (i)	during the initial one-year period the entity took action necessary to respond to the change in circumstances,
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (ii)	the non-current asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed at a price that is reasonable, given the change in circumstances, and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (iii)	the criteria in paragraphs 7 and 8 are met.

            Note: This appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose of this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 105 and the corresponding International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

            Comparison with IFRS 5,

          <font size="2">
           <br/>
           1	The transitional provisions given in IFRS 5 have not been given in Ind AS 105, since all transitional provisions related to Ind ASs, wherever considered appropriate have been included in Ind AS 101,
           <i>
            First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards,
           </i>
           corresponding to IFRS 1
           <i>
            , First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
           </i>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2	Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance sheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’ and ‘Statement of profit and loss’ is used instead of ‘Statement of comprehensive income’. Words ‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead of ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of financial statements considered for the purpose of events after the reporting period.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           3	Requirements regarding presentation of discontinued operations in  the separate income statement, where separate income statement is  presented under paragraph 33A of IFRS 5 have been deleted. This change is consequential to the removal of option regarding two statement approach in Ind AS 1. Ind AS 1 requires that the components of profit or loss and components of other comprehensive income shall be presented as a part of the statement of profit and loss. However, paragraph number 33A has been retained in Ind AS 105 to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IFRS 5.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           4	Paragraph 5(d) of IFRS 5 deals with non-current assets that are accounted for in accordance with the fair value model in IAS 40, Investment Property. Since Ind AS 40 prohibits the use of fair value model, this paragraph is deleted in Ind AS 105.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5	Paragraph 7 prescribes the conditions for classification of a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale. A clarification has been added in Paragraph 7 that the non-current asset (or disposal group) cannot be classified as held for sale, if the entity intends to sell it in a distant future.

          However, once the cash flows from an asset or group of assets are  expected to arise principally from sale rather than continuing use, they  become less dependent on cash flows arising from other assets, and a  disposal group that was part of a cash-generating unit becomes a  separate cash-generating unit.
