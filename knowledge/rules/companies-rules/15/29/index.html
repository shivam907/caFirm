By contrast:<br><br>(a) trade payables are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied and have been invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier; and<br><br>(b) accruals are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have not been paid, invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier, including amounts due to employees (for example, amounts relating to accrued vacation pay). Although it is sometimes necessary to estimate the amount or timing of accruals, the uncertainty is generally much less than for provisions.<br><br>Accruals are often reported as part of trade and other payables, whereas provisions are reported separately.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Relationship between provisions and contingent liabilities</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>12 In a general sense, all provisions are contingent because they are uncertain in timing or amount. However, within this Standard the term ‘contingent’ is used for liabilities and assets that are not recognised because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity. In addition, the term ‘contingent liability’ is used for liabilities that do not meet the recognition criteria.<br><br>13 This Standard distinguishes between:<br><br>(a) provisions – which are recognised as liabilities (assuming that a reliable estimate can be made) because they are present obligations and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations; and<br><br>(b) contingent liabilities – which are not recognised as liabilities because they are either:<br><br>(i) possible obligations, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits; or<br><br>(ii) present obligations that do not meet the recognition criteria in this Standard (because either it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made).</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs32645C0C">Recognition</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Provisions<br><br>14 A provision shall be recognised when:<br><br>(a) an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;<br><br>(b) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and<br><br>(c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5E98E930">If these conditions are not met, no provision shall be recognised.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5E98E930">Present obligation</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5E98E930">15 In rare cases, it is not clear whether there is a present obligation. In these cases, a past event is deemed to give rise to a present obligation if, taking account of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>16 In almost all cases it will be clear whether a past event has given rise to a present obligation. In rare cases, for example in a lawsuit, it may be disputed either whether certain events have occurred or whether those events result in a present obligation. In such a case, an entity determines whether a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period by taking account of all available evidence, including, for example, the opinion of experts. The evidence considered includes any additional evidence provided by events after the reporting period. On the basis of such evidence:<br><br>(a) where it is more likely than not that a present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period, the entity recognises a provision (if the recognition criteria are met); and<br><br>(b) where it is more likely that no present obligation exists at the end of the reporting period, the entity discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 86).<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Past event</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>17 A past event that leads to a present obligation is called an obligating event. For an event to be an obligating event, it is necessary that the entity has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation created by the event. This is the case only:<br><br>(a) where the settlement of the obligation can be enforced by law; or<br><br>(b) in the case of a constructive obligation, where the event (which may be an action of the entity) creates valid expectations in other parties that the entity will discharge the obligation.<br><br>18 Financial statements deal with the financial position of an entity at the end of its reporting period and not its possible position in the future. Therefore, no provision is recognised for costs that need to be incurred to operate in the future. The only liabilities recognised in an entity’s balance sheet are those that exist at the end of the reporting period.<br><br>19 It is only those obligations arising from past events existing independently of an entity’s future actions (ie the future conduct of its business) that are recognised as provisions. Examples of such obligations are penalties or clean-up costs for unlawful environmental damage, both of which would lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement regardless of the future actions of the entity. Similarly, an entity recognises a provision for the decommissioning costs of an oil installation or a nuclear power station to the extent that the entity is obliged to rectify damage already caused. In contrast, because of commercial pressures or legal requirements, an entity may intend or need to carry out expenditure to operate in a particular way in the future (for example, by fitting smoke filters in a certain type of factory). Because the entity can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for example by changing its method of operation, it has no present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.<br><br>20 An obligation always involves another party to whom the obligation is owed. It is not necessary, however, to know the identity of the party to whom the obligation is owed—indeed the obligation may be to the public at large. Because an obligation always involves a commitment to another party, it follows that a management or board decision does not give rise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period unless the decision has been communicated before the end of the reporting period to those affected by it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will discharge its responsibilities.<br><br>21 An event that does not give rise to an obligation immediately may do so at a later date, because of changes in the law or because an act (for example, a sufficiently specific public statement) by the entity gives rise to a constructive obligation. For example, when environmental damage is caused there may be no obligation to remedy the consequences. However, the causing of the damage will become an obligating event when a new law requires the existing damage to be rectified or when the entity publicly accepts responsibility for rectification in a way that creates a constructive obligation.<br><br>22 Where details of a proposed new law have yet to be finalised, an obligation arises only when the legislation is virtually certain to be enacted as drafted. For the purpose of this Standard, such an obligation is treated as a legal obligation. Differences in circumstances surrounding enactment make it impossible to specify a single event that would make the enactment of a law virtually certain. In many cases it will be impossible to be virtually certain of the enactment of a law until it is enacted.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>23 For a liability to qualify for recognition there must be not only a present obligation but also the probability of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits to settle that obligation. For the purpose of this Standard,</span><span class="csA16174BA"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="csA16174BA"> an outflow of resources or other event is regarded as probable if the event is more likely than not to occur, ie the probability that the event will occur is greater than the probability that it will not. Where it is not probable that a present obligation exists, an entity discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 86).<br><br>24 Where there are a number of similar obligations (eg product warranties or similar contracts) the probability that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. Although the likelihood of outflow for any one item may be small, it may well be probable that some outflow of resources will be needed to settle the class of obligations as a whole. If that is the case, a provision is recognised (if the other recognition criteria are met).<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Reliable estimate of the obligation<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>25 The use of estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial statements and does not undermine their reliability. This is especially true in the case of provisions, which by their nature are more uncertain than most other items in the balance sheet. Except in extremely rare cases, an entity will be able to determine a range of possible outcomes and can therefore make an estimate of the obligation that is sufficiently reliable to use in recognising a provision.<br><br>26 In the extremely rare case where no reliable estimate can be made, a liability exists that cannot be recognised. That liability is disclosed as a contingent liability (see paragraph 86).<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Contingent liabilities<br><br>27 An entity shall not recognise a contingent liability.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>28 A contingent liability is disclosed, as required by paragraph 86, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.<br><br>29 Where an entity is jointly and severally liable for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability. The entity recognises a provision for the part of the obligation for which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable, except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made.<br><br>30 Contingent liabilities may develop in a way not initially expected. Therefore, they are assessed continually to determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow of future economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change in probability occurs (except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made).<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Contingent assets<br><br>31 An entity shall not recognise a contingent asset.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>32 Contingent assets usually arise from unplanned or other unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the entity. An example is a claim that an entity is pursuing through legal processes, where the outcome is uncertain.<br><br>33 Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.<br><br>34 A contingent asset is disclosed, as required by paragraph 89, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.<br><br>35 Contingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. If an inflow of economic benefits has become probable, an entity discloses the contingent asset (see paragraph 89).<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Measurement</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Best estimate</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">36 The amount recognised as a provision shall be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>37 The best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation is the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time. It will often be impossible or prohibitively expensive to settle or transfer an obligation at the end of the reporting period. However, the estimate of the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle or transfer the obligation gives the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.<br><br>38 The estimates of outcome and financial effect are determined by the judgement of the management of the entity, supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts. The evidence considered includes any additional evidence provided by events after the reporting period.<br><br>39 Uncertainties surrounding the amount to be recognised as a provision are dealt with by various means according to the circumstances. Where the provision being measured involves a large population of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated probabilities. The name for this statistical method of estimation is ‘expected value’. The provision will therefore be different depending on whether the probability of a loss of a given amount is, for example, 60 per cent or 90 per cent. Where there is a continuous range of possible outcomes, and each point in that range is as likely as any other, the mid-point of the range is used.</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" width="55%">

		<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csA16174BA">40 Where a single obligation is being measured, the individual most likely outcome may be the best estimate of the liability. However, even in such a case, the entity considers other possible outcomes. Where other possible outcomes are either mostly higher or mostly lower than the most likely outcome, the best estimate will be a higher or lower amount. For example, if an entity has to rectify a serious fault in a major plant that it has constructed for a customer, the individual most likely outcome may be for the repair to succeed at the first attempt at a cost of Rs 1,000, but a provision for a larger amount is made if there is a significant chance that further attempts will be necessary.<br><br>41 The provision is measured before tax, as the tax consequences of the provision, and changes in it, are dealt with under Ind AS 12.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Risks and uncertainties<br><br>42 The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances shall be taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a provision.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>43 Risk describes variability of outcome. A risk adjustment may increase the amount at which a liability is measured. Caution is needed in making judgements under conditions of uncertainty, so that income or assets are not overstated and expenses or liabilities are not understated. However, uncertainty does not justify the creation of excessive provisions or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities. For example, if the projected costs of a particularly adverse outcome are estimated on a prudent basis, that outcome is not then deliberately treated as more probable than is realistically the case. Care is needed to avoid duplicating adjustments for risk and uncertainty with consequent overstatement of a provision.<br><br>44 Disclosure of the uncertainties surrounding the amount of the expenditure is made under paragraph 85(b).<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Present value<br><br>45 Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>46 Because of the time value of money, provisions relating to cash outflows that arise soon after the reporting period are more onerous than those where cash outflows of the same amount arise later.

For example, an entity may believe that the cost of cleaning up a site at the end of its life will be reduced by future changes in technology. The amount recognised reflects a reasonable expectation of technically qualified, objective observers, taking account of all available evidence as to the technology that will be available at the time of the clean-up. Thus it is appropriate to include, for example, expected cost reductions associated with increased experience in applying existing technology or the expected cost of applying existing technology to a larger or more complex clean-up operation than has previously been carried out. However, an entity does not anticipate the development of a completely new technology for cleaning up unless it is supported by sufficient objective evidence.<br><br>50 The effect of possible new legislation is taken into consideration in measuring an existing obligation when sufficient objective evidence exists that the legislation is virtually certain to be enacted. The variety of circumstances that arise in practice makes it impossible to specify a single event that will provide sufficient, objective evidence in every case. Evidence is required both of what legislation will demand and of whether it is virtually certain to be enacted and implemented in due course. In many cases sufficient objective evidence will not exist until the new legislation is enacted.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Expected disposal of assets<br><br>51 Gains from the expected disposal of assets shall not be taken into account in measuring a provision.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>52 Gains on the expected disposal of assets are not taken into account in measuring a provision, even if the expected disposal is closely linked to the event giving rise to the provision.

The other party may either reimburse amounts paid by the entity or pay the amounts directly.<br><br>56 In most cases the entity will remain liable for the whole of the amount in question so that the entity would have to settle the full amount if the third party failed to pay for any reason. In this situation, a provision is recognised for the full amount of the liability, and a separate asset for the expected reimbursement is recognised when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the liability.<br><br>57 In some cases, the entity will not be liable for the costs in question if the third party fails to pay. In such a case the entity has no liability for those costs and they are not included in the provision.<br><br>58 As noted in paragraph 29, an obligation for which an entity is jointly and severally liable is a contingent liability to the extent that it is expected that the obligation will be settled by the other parties.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Changes in provisions<br><br>59 Provisions shall be reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

Executory contracts that are not onerous fall outside the scope of this Standard.<br><br>68 This Standard defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.

A public announcement of a detailed plan to restructure constitutes a constructive obligation to restructure only if it is made in such a way and in sufficient detail (ie setting out the main features of the plan) that it gives rise to valid expectations in other parties such as customers, suppliers and employees (or their representatives) that the entity will carry out the restructuring.<br><br>74 For a plan to be sufficient to give rise to a constructive obligation when communicated to those affected by it, its implementation needs to be planned to begin as soon as possible and to be completed in a timeframe that makes significant changes to the plan unlikely. If it is expected that there will be a long delay before the restructuring begins or that the restructuring will take an unreasonably long time, it is unlikely that the plan will raise a valid expectation on the part of others that the entity is at present committed to restructuring, because the timeframe allows opportunities for the entity to change its plans.</span></p><p class="csC4290383"><span class="cs1996077C"><sup></sup></span><a class="csEC80D8B8" href="#standard37_k"><span class="cs48129E1B"><sup>k</sup></span></a><span class="cs1996077C">[</span><span class="cs6F1C9309">75&nbsp;A management or board decision to restructure taken before the end of the reporting period does not give rise to a constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period unless the entity has, before the end of the reporting period-</span></p><p class="csC4290383"><span class="cs6F1C9309">(a) started to implement the restructuring plan; or</span></p><p class="csC4290383"><span class="cs6F1C9309">(b) announced the main features of the restructuring plan to those affected by it in a sufficiently specific manner to raise a valid expectation in them that the entity will carry out the restructuring.</span></p><p class="csC4290383"><span class="cs6F1C9309">If an entity starts to implement a restructuring plan, or announces its main features to those affected, only after the reporting period, disclosure is required under Ind AS 10 Events after the Reporting Period, if the restructuring is material and non-disclosure could reasonably be expected to influencedecisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.</span><span class="cs1996077C">]</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csA16174BA">76 Although a constructive obligation is not created solely by a management decision, an obligation may result from other earlier events together with such a decision.

The funds may have one of the following structures:<br><br>(a) funds that are established by a single contributor to fund its own decommissioning obligations, whether for a particular site, or for a number of geographically dispersed sites.<br><br>(b) funds that are established with multiple contributors to fund their individual or joint decommissioning obligations, when contributors are entitled to reimbursement for decommissioning expenses to the extent of their contributions plus any actual earnings on those contributions less their share of the costs of administering the fund. Contributors may have an obligation to make additional contributions, for example, in the event of the bankruptcy of another contributor.<br><br>(c) funds that are established with multiple contributors to fund their individual or joint decommissioning obligations when the required level of contributions is based on the current activity of a contributor and the benefit obtained by that contributor is based on its past activity. In such cases there is a potential mismatch in the amount of contributions made by a contributor (based on current activity) and the value realisable from the fund (based on past activity).<br><br>3 Such funds generally have the following features:<br><br>(a) the fund is separately administered by independent trustees.<br><br>(b) entities (contributors) make contributions to the fund, which are invested in a range of assets that may include both debt and equity investments, and are available to help pay the contributors’ decommissioning costs. The trustees determine how contributions are invested, within the constraints set by the fund’s governing documents and any applicable legislation or other regulations.<br><br>(c) the contributors retain the obligation to pay decommissioning costs. However, contributors are able to obtain reimbursement of decommissioning costs from the fund up to the lower of the decommissioning costs incurred and the contributor’s share of assets of the fund.<br><br>(d) the contributors may have restricted access or no access to any surplus of assets of the fund over those used to meet eligible decommissioning costs.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Scope</span><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;<br><br>4 This Appendix applies to accounting in the financial statements of a contributor for interests arising from decommissioning funds that have both of the following features:<br><br>(a) the assets are administered separately (either by being held in a separate legal entity or as segregated assets within another entity); and<br><br>(b) a contributor’s right to access the assets is restricted.<br><br>5 A residual interest in a fund that extends beyond a right to reimbursement, such as a contractual right to distributions once all the decommissioning has been completed or on winding up the fund, may be an equity instrument within the scope of Ind AS 109 and is not within the scope of this Appendix.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Issues</span><span class="csA16174BA">&nbsp;<br><br>6 The issues addressed in this Appendix are:<br><br>(a) how should a contributor account for its interest in a fund?<br><br>(b) when a contributor has an obligation to make additional contributions, for example, in the event of the bankruptcy of another contributor, how should that obligation be accounted for?<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Accounting Principles</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Accounting for an interest in a fund</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>7 The contributor shall recognise its obligation to pay decommissioning costs as a liability and recognise its interest in the fund separately unless the contributor is not liable to pay decommissioning costs even if the fund fails to pay.<br><br>8 The contributor shall determine whether it has control or joint control of, or significant influence over, the fund by reference to Ind AS 110, Consolidated Financial Statements, Ind AS 111, Joint Arrangements, and Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.

The Directive distinguishes between ‘new’ and ‘historical’ waste and between waste from private households and waste from sources other than private households. New waste relates to products sold after 13 August 2005. All household equipment sold before that date is deemed to give rise to historical waste for the purposes of the Directive.<br><br>4 The Directive states that the cost of waste management for historical household equipment should be borne by producers of that type of equipment that are in the market during a period to be specified in the applicable legislation of each Member State (the measurement period). The Directive states that each Member State shall establish a mechanism to have producers contribute to costs proportionately ‘e.g. in proportion to their respective share of the market by type of equipment.’<br><br>5 Several terms used in this Appendix such as ‘market share’ and ‘measurement period’ may be defined very differently in the applicable legislation of individual Member States. For example, the length of the measurement period might be a year or only one month. Similarly, the measurement of market share and the formulae for computing the obligation may differ in the various national legislations. However, all of these examples affect only the measurement of the liability, which is not within the scope of this Appendix.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Scope</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>6 This Appendix provides guidance on the recognition, in the financial statements of producers, of liabilities for waste management under the EU Directive on WE&amp;EE in respect of sales of historical household equipment.<br><br>7 This Appendix addresses neither new waste nor historical waste from sources other than private households. The liability for such waste management is adequately covered in Ind AS 37. However, if, in national legislation, new waste from private households is treated in a similar manner to historical waste from private households, the principles of this Appendix apply by reference to the hierarchy in paragraphs 10-12 of Ind AS 8. The Ind AS 8 hierarchy is also relevant for other regulations that impose obligations in a way that is similar to the cost attribution model specified in the EU Directive.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Issue</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>8 This Appendix determines in the context of the decommissioning of WE&amp;EE what constitutes the obligating event in accordance with paragraph 14(a) of Ind AS 37 for the recognition of a provision for waste management costs:<br><br>• the manufacture or sale of the historical household equipment?<br><br>• participation in the market during the measurement period?<br><br>• the incurrence of costs in the performance of waste management activities?<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Accounting Principles<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>9 Participation in the market during the measurement period is the obligating event in accordance with paragraph 14(a) of Ind AS 37. As a consequence, a liability for waste management costs for historical household equipment does not arise as the products are manufactured or sold. Because the obligation for historical household equipment is linked to participation in the market during the measurement period, rather than to production or sale of the items to be disposed of, there is no obligation unless and until a market share exists during the measurement period. The timing of the obligating event may also be independent of the particular period in which the activities to perform the waste management are undertaken and the related costs incurred.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Appendix C<br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Levies</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>This Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Background</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>1. A government may impose a levy on an entity. An issue arises when to recognise a liability to pay a levy that is accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.<br></span><span class="cs5E98E930"><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Scope</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>2. This Appendix addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of Ind AS 37. It also addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain.<br><br>3. This Appendix does not address the accounting for the costs that arise from recognising a liability to pay a levy. Entities should apply other Standards to decide whether the recognition of a liability to pay a levy gives rise to an asset or an expense.<br><br>4. For the purposes of this Appendix, a levy is an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that is imposed by governments on entities in accordance with legislation (ie laws and/or regulations), other than:<br><br>(a) those outflows of resources that are within the scope of other Standards (such as income taxes that are within the scope of Ind AS 12, Income Taxes); and<br><br>(b) fines or other penalties that are imposed for breaches of the legislation.<br><br>‘Government’ refers to government, government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international.<br><br>5. A payment made by an entity for the acquisition of an asset, or for the rendering of services under a contractual agreement with a government, does not meet the definition of a levy.<br><br>6. An entity is not required to apply this Appendix to liabilities that arise from emissions trading schemes.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Issues</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>7. To clarify the accounting for a liability to pay a levy, this Appendix addresses the following issues:<br><br>(a) what is the obligating event that gives rise to the recognition of a liability to pay a levy?<br>(b) does economic compulsion to continue to operate in a future period create a constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in that future period?<br>(c) does the going concern assumption imply that an entity has a present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period?<br>(d) does the recognition of a liability to pay a levy arise at a point in time or does it, in some circumstances, arise progressively over time?<br>(e) what is the obligating event that gives rise to the recognition of a liability to pay a levy that is triggered if a minimum threshold is reached?<br><br>(f) are the principles for recognising in the annual financial statements and in the interim financial report a liability to pay a levy the same?<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Accounting Principles<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>8. The obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation. For example, if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy is the generation of revenue in the current period and the calculation of that levy is based on the revenue that was generated in a previous period, the obligating event for that levy is the generation of revenue in the current period. The generation of revenue in the previous period is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation.<br><br>9. An entity does not have a constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period as a result of the entity being economically compelled to continue to operate in that future period.<br><br>10. The preparation of financial statements under the going concern assumption does not imply that an entity has a present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period.<br><br>11. The liability to pay a levy is recognised progressively if the obligating event occurs over a period of time (ie if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation, occurs over a period of time). For example, if the<br><br>obligating event is the generation of revenue over a period of time, the corresponding liability is recognised as the entity generates that revenue.<br><br>12. If an obligation to pay a levy is triggered when a minimum threshold is reached, the accounting for the liability that arises from that obligation shall be consistent with the principles established in paragraphs 8–14 of this Appendix (in particular, paragraphs 8 and 11). For example, if the obligating event is the reaching of a minimum activity threshold (such as a minimum amount of revenue or sales generated or outputs produced), the corresponding liability is recognised when that minimum activity threshold is reached.<br><br>13. An entity shall apply the same recognition principles in the interim financial report that it applies in the annual financial statements. As a result, in the interim financial report, a liability to pay a levy:<br><br>(a) shall not be recognised if there is no present obligation to pay the levy at the end of the interim reporting period; and<br>(b) shall be recognised if a present obligation to pay the levy exists at the end of the interim reporting period.<br><br>14. An entity shall recognise an asset if it has prepaid a levy but does not yet have a present obligation to pay that levy.<br><br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Appendix D<br>References to matters contained in other Indian Accounting Standards<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="csD007A21A">This Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>This appendix lists the appendices which are part of other Indian Accounting Standards and makes references to Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.<br><br></span><span class="cs1996077C"><a class="csEC80D8B8" href="#MCAh"><span class="cs48129E1B">h</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">[(i) Appendix D, Service Concession Arrangements and Appendix E, Service Concession Arrangements: Disclosures, contained in Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.]</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csA16174BA">(ii) Appendix A, Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities, contained in Ind AS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.<br><br>(iii) Appendix B, Evaluating the Substance of Transactions involving the Legal Form of a Lease contained in Ind AS 17, Leases.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Appendix 1</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>Note: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard.
