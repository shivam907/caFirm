          1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the procedures that an entity applies to ensure that its assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount. An asset is carried at more than its recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the asset. If this is the case, the asset is described as impaired and the Standard requires the entity to recognise an impairment loss. The Standard also specifies when an entity should reverse an impairment loss and prescribes disclosures.

          5 This Standard does not apply to financial assets within the scope of Ind AS 109, or biological assets related to agricultural activity measured at fair value less costs to sell within the scope of Ind AS 41. However, this Standard applies to assets that are carried at revalued amount (ie fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses) in accordance with other Ind ASs, such as the revaluation model in Ind AS 16,
          <i>
           Property, Plant and Equipment
          </i>
          and Ind AS 38,
          <i>
           Intangible Assets
          </i>
          . The only difference between an asset's fair value and its fair value less costs of disposal is the direct incremental costs attributable to the disposal of the asset.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) If the disposal costs are negligible, the recoverable amount of the revalued asset is necessarily close to, or greater than, its revalued amount. In this case, after the revaluation requirements have been applied, it is unlikely that the revalued asset is impaired and recoverable amount need not be estimated.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) [Refer Appendix 1]
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) If the disposal costs are not negligible, the fair value less costs of disposal of the revalued asset is necessarily less than its fair value. Therefore, the revalued asset will be impaired if its value in use is less than its revalued amount. In this case, after the revaluation requirements have been applied, an entity applies this Standard to determine whether the asset may be impaired.

           6 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Carrying amount is the amount at which an asset is recognised after deducting any accumulated depreciation (amortisation) and accumulated impairment losses thereon.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Corporate assets are assets other than goodwill that contribute to the future cash flows of both the cash-generating unit under review and other cash- generating units.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Costs of disposal are incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset or cash-generating unit, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost in the financial statements, less its residual value.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Depreciation (Amortisation) is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.
           <sup>

           </sup>
           <br/>

           Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. (See Ind AS 113, Fair Value Measurement.)
           <br/>
           <br/>
           An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.

           Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.

          (a) paragraphs 18–57 set out the requirements for measuring recoverable amount. These requirements also use the term ‘an asset’ but apply equally to an individual asset and a cash-generating unit.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) paragraphs 58–108 set out the requirements for recognising and measuring impairment losses. Recognition and measurement of impairment losses for individual assets other than goodwill are dealt with in paragraphs 58–64. Paragraphs 65–108 deal with the recognition and measurement of impairment losses for cash-generating units and goodwill.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) paragraphs 109–116 set out the requirements for reversing an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset or a cash-generating unit. Again, these requirements use the term ‘an asset’ but apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit. Additional requirements for an individual asset are set out in paragraphs 117–121, for a cash-generating unit in paragraphs 122 and 123, and for goodwill in paragraphs 124 and 125.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (d) paragraphs 126–133 specify the information to be disclosed about impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses for assets and cash- generating units. Paragraphs 134–137 specify additional disclosure requirements for cash-generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated for impairment testing purposes.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          8 An asset is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Paragraphs 12–14 describe some indications that an impairment loss may have occurred. If any of those indications is present, an entity is required to make a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Except as described in paragraph 10, this Standard does not require an entity to make a formal estimate of recoverable amount if no indication of an impairment loss is present.

           13 The list in paragraph 12 is not exhaustive.

           <br/>

           (a) cash flows for acquiring the asset, or subsequent cash needs for operating or maintaining it, that are significantly higher than those originally budgeted;

           (c) a significant decline in budgeted net cash flows or operating profit, or a significant increase in budgeted loss, flowing from the asset; or

           <br/>
           (d) operating losses or net cash outflows for the asset, when current period amounts are aggregated with budgeted amounts for the future.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           15 As indicated in paragraph 10, this Standard requires an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or not yet available for use and goodwill to be tested for impairment, at least annually. Apart from when the requirements in paragraph 10 apply, the concept of materiality applies in identifying whether the recoverable amount of an asset needs to be estimated. For example, if previous calculations show that an asset’s recoverable amount is significantly greater than its carrying amount, the entity need not re-estimate the asset’s recoverable amount if no events have occurred that would eliminate that difference. Similarly, previous analysis may show that an asset’s recoverable amount is not sensitive to one (or more) of the indications listed in paragraph 12.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           16 As an illustration of paragraph 15, if market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased during the period, an entity is not required to make a formal estimate of an asset’s recoverable amount in the following cases:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) if the discount rate used in calculating the asset’s value in use is unlikely to be affected by the increase in these market rates. For example, increases in short-term interest rates may not have a material effect on the discount rate used for an asset that has a long remaining useful life.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) if the discount rate used in calculating the asset’s value in use is likely to be affected by the increase in these market rates but previous sensitivity analysis of recoverable amount shows that:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (i) it is unlikely that there will be a material decrease in recoverable amount because future cash flows are also likely to increase (eg in some cases, an entity may be able to demonstrate that it adjusts its revenues to compensate for any increase in market rates); or
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (ii) the decrease in recoverable amount is unlikely to result in a material impairment loss.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           17 If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, this may indicate that the remaining useful life, the depreciation (amortisation) method or the residual value for the asset needs to be reviewed and adjusted in accordance with the Standard applicable to the asset, even if no impairment loss is recognised for the asset.

           <br/>
           18 This Standard defines recoverable amount as the higher of an asset’s or cash- generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Paragraphs 19–57 set out the requirements for measuring recoverable amount. These requirements use the term ‘an asset’ but apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           19 It is not always necessary to determine both an asset’s fair value less costs of disposaland its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the asset’s carrying amount, the asset is not impaired and it is not necessary to estimate the other amount.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           20 It may be possible to measure fair value less costs of disposal, even if there is not a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset . However, sometimes it will not be possible to measure fair value less costs of disposal because there is no basis for making a reliable estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. In this case, the entity may use the asset’s value in use as its recoverable amount.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           21 If there is no reason to believe that an asset’s value in use materially exceeds its fair value less costs of disposal, the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal may be used as its recoverable amount. This will often be the case for an asset that is held for disposal. This is because the value in use of an asset held for disposal will consist mainly of the net disposal proceeds, as the future cash flows from continuing use of the asset until its disposal are likely to be negligible.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           22 Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (see paragraphs 65–103), unless either:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal is higher than its carrying amount; or
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) the asset’s value in use can be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs of disposal and fair value less costs of disposal can be measured.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           23 In some cases, estimates, averages and computational short cuts may provide reasonable approximations of the detailed computations illustrated in this Standard for determining fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.

           24 Paragraph 10 requires an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life to be tested for impairment annually by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount, irrespective of whether there is any indication that it may be impaired. However, the most recent detailed calculation of such an asset’s recoverable amount made in a preceding period may be used in the impairment test for that asset in the current period, provided all of the following criteria are met:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) if the intangible asset does not generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and is therefore tested for impairment as part of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs, the assets and liabilities making up that unit have not changed significantly since the most recent recoverable amount calculation;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) the most recent recoverable amount calculation resulted in an amount that exceeded the asset’s carrying amount by a substantial margin; and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c) based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent recoverable amount calculation, the likelihood that a current recoverable amount determination would be less than the asset’s carrying amount is remote.

          28 Costs of disposal, other than those that have been recognised as liabilities, are deducted in measuring fair value less costs of disposal. Examples of such costs are legal costs, stamp duty and similar transaction taxes, costs of removing the asset, and direct incremental costs to bring an asset into condition for its sale. However, termination benefits (as defined in Ind AS 19) and costs associated with reducing or reorganising a business following the disposal of an asset are not direct incremental costs to dispose of the asset.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          29 Sometimes, the disposal of an asset would require the buyer to assume a liability and only a single fair value less costs of disposal is available for both the asset and the liability. Paragraph 78 explains how to deal with such cases.

            <br/>
            (a) base cash flow projections on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset. Greater weight shall be given to external evidence.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            (b) base cash flow projections on the most recent financial budgets/forecasts approved by management, but shall exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings or from improving or enhancing the asset’s performance. Projections based on these budgets/forecasts shall cover a maximum period of five years, unless a longer period can be justified.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            (c) estimate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts by extrapolating the projections based on the budgets/forecasts using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. This growth rate shall not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in which the asset is used, unless a higher rate can be justified.

           </b>
           <br/>
           34 Management assesses the reasonableness of the assumptions on which its current cash flow projections are based by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows. Management shall ensure that the assumptions on which its current cash flow projections are based are consistent with past actual outcomes, provided the effects of subsequent events or circumstances that did not exist when those actual cash flows were generated make this appropriate.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           35 Detailed, explicit and reliable financial budgets/forecasts of future cash flows for periods longer than five years are generally not available. For this reason, management’s estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent budgets/forecasts for a maximum of five years. Management may use cash flow projections based on financial budgets/forecasts over a period longer than five years if it is confident that these projections are reliable and it can demonstrate its ability, based on past experience, to forecast cash flows accurately over that longer period.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           36 Cash flow projections until the end of an asset’s useful life are estimated by extrapolating the cash flow projections based on the financial budgets/forecasts using a growth rate for subsequent years. This rate is steady or declining, unless an increase in the rate matches objective information about patterns over a product or industry lifecycle. If appropriate, the growth rate is zero or negative.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           37 When conditions are favourable, competitors are likely to enter the market and restrict growth. Therefore, entities will have difficulty in exceeding the average historical growth rate over the long term (say, twenty years) for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in which the asset is used.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           38 In using information from financial budgets/forecasts, an entity considers whether the information reflects reasonable and supportable assumptions and represents management’s best estimate of the set of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset.

           40 Estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate reflect consistent assumptions about price increases attributable to general inflation. Therefore, if the discount rate includes the effect of price increases attributable to general inflation, future cash flows are estimated in nominal terms. If the discount rate excludes the effect of price increases attributable to general inflation, future cash flows are estimated in real terms (but include future specific price increases or decreases).
           <br/>
           <br/>
           41 Projections of cash outflows include those for the day-to-day servicing of the asset as well as future overheads that can be attributed directly, or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis, to the use of the asset.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           42 When the carrying amount of an asset does not yet include all the cash outflows to be incurred before it is ready for use or sale, the estimate of future cash outflows includes an estimate of any further cash outflow that is expected to be incurred before the asset is ready for use or sale. For example, this is the case for a building under construction or for a development project that is not yet completed.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           43 To avoid double-counting, estimates of future cash flows do not include:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) cash inflows from assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from the asset under review (for example, financial assets such as receivables); and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) cash outflows that relate to obligations that have been recognised as liabilities (for example, payables, pensions or provisions).

           <br/>
           45 Because future cash flows are estimated for the asset in its current condition, value in use does not reflect:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) future cash outflows or related cost savings (for example reductions in staff costs) or benefits that are expected to arise from a future restructuring to which an entity is not yet committed; or
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) future cash outflows that will improve or enhance the asset’s performance or the related cash inflows that are expected to arise from such outflows.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           46 A restructuring is a programme that is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either the scope of the business undertaken by an entity or the manner in which the business is conducted. Ind AS 37,
           <i>
            Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
           </i>
           , contains guidance clarifying when an entity is committed to a restructuring.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           47 When an entity becomes committed to a restructuring, some assets are likely to be affected by this restructuring. Once the entity is committed to the restructuring:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) its estimates of future cash inflows and cash outflows for the purpose of determining value in use reflect the cost savings and other benefits from the restructuring (based on the most recent financial budgets/forecasts approved by management); and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) its estimates of future cash outflows for the restructuring are included in a restructuring provision in accordance with Ind AS 37.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           48 Until an entity incurs cash outflows that improve or enhance the asset’s performance, estimates of future cash flows do not include the estimated future cash inflows that are expected to arise from the increase in economic benefits associated with the cash outflow.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           49 Estimates of future cash flows include future cash outflows necessary to maintain the level of economic benefits expected to arise from the asset in its current condition. When a cash-generating unit consists of assets with different estimated useful lives, all of which are essential to the ongoing operation of the unit, the replacement of assets with shorter lives is considered to be part of the day-to-day servicing of the unit when estimating the future cash flows associated with the unit. Similarly, when a single asset consists of components with different estimated useful lives, the replacement of components with shorter lives is considered to be part of the day-to-day servicing of the asset when estimating the future cash flows generated by the asset.

           51 Estimated future cash flows reflect assumptions that are consistent with the way the discount rate is determined. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be counted twice or ignored. Because the time value of money is considered by discounting the estimated future cash flows, these cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows from financing activities. Similarly, because the discount rate is determined on a pre-tax basis, future cash flows are also estimated on a pre-tax basis.

           </b>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           53 The estimate of net cash flows to be received (or paid) for the disposal of an asset at the end of its useful life is determined in a similar way to an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal, except that, in estimating those net cash flows:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) an entity uses prices prevailing at the date of the estimate for similar assets that have reached the end of their useful life and have operated under conditions similar to those in which the asset will be used.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c) the entity adjusts those prices for the effect of both future price increases due to general inflation and specific future price increases or decreases. However, if estimates of future cash flows from the asset’s continuing use and the discount rate exclude the effect of general inflation, the entity also excludes this effect from the estimate of net cash flows on disposal.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           53A Fair value differs from value in use. Fair value reflects the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset. In contrast, value in use reflects the effects of factors that may be specific to the entity and not applicable to entities in general. For example, fair value does not reflect any of the following factors to the extent that they would not be generally available to market participants:

          56 A rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset is the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive from the asset. This rate is estimated from the rate implicit in current market transactions for similar assets or from the weighted average cost of capital of a listed entity that has a single asset (or a portfolio of assets) similar in terms of service potential and risks to the asset under review. However, the discount rate(s) used to measure an asset’s value in use shall not reflect risks for which the future cash flow estimates have been adjusted. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double- counted.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          57 When an asset-specific rate is not directly available from the market, an entity uses surrogates to estimate the discount rate. Appendix A provides additional guidance on estimating the discount rate in such circumstances.

          68 As defined in paragraph 6, an asset’s cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Identification of an asset’s cash-generating unit involves judgement. If recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, an entity identifies the lowest aggregation of assets that generate largely independent cash inflows.

          69 Cash inflows are inflows of cash and cash equivalents received from parties external to the entity. In identifying whether cash inflows from an asset (or group of assets) are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets (or groups of assets), an entity considers various factors including how management monitors the entity’s operations (such as by product lines, businesses, individual locations, districts or regional areas) or how management makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity’s assets and operations..

          <b>
           70 If an active market exists for the output produced by an asset or group of assets, that asset or group of assets shall be identified as a cash-generating unit, even if some or all of the output is used internally. If the cash inflows generated by any asset or cash-generating unit are affected by internal transfer pricing, an entity shall use management’s best estimate of future price(s) that could be achieved in arm’s length transactions in estimating:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) the future cash inflows used to determine the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s value in use; and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) the future cash outflows used to determine the value in use of any other assets or cash-generating units that are affected by the internal transfer pricing.
          </b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          71 Even if part or all of the output produced by an asset or a group of assets is used by other units of the entity (for example, products at an intermediate stage of a production process), this asset or group of assets forms a separate cash-generating unit if the entity could sell the output on an active market. This is because the asset or group of assets could generate cash inflows that would be largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. In using information based on financial budgets/forecasts that relates to such a cash- generating unit, or to any other asset or cash-generating unit affected by internal transfer pricing, an entity adjusts this information if internal transfer prices do not reflect management’s best estimate of future prices that could be achieved in arm’s length transactions.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
           72 Cash-generating units shall be identified consistently from period to period for the same asset or types of assets, unless a change is justified.
           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          73 If an entity determines that an asset belongs to a cash-generating unit different from that in previous periods, or that the types of assets aggregated for the asset’s cash-generating unit have changed, paragraph 130 requires disclosures about the cash-generating unit, if an impairment loss is recognised or reversed for the cash- generating unit.

           <br/>
          </b>
          <br/>
          74 The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is the higher of the cash- generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purpose of determining the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit, any reference in paragraphs 19–57 to ‘an asset’ is read as a reference to ‘a cash- generating unit’.

           75 The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit shall be determined on a basis consistent with the way the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined.

          </b>
          <br/>
          76 The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) includes the carrying amount of only those assets that can be attributed directly, or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis, to the cash- generating unit and will generate the future cash inflows used in determining the cash-generating unit’s value in use; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) does not include the carrying amount of any recognised liability, unless the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit cannot be determined without consideration of this liability.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This is because fair value less costs of disposal and value in use of a cash- generating unit are determined excluding cash flows that relate to assets that are not part of the cash-generating unit and liabilities that have been recognised (see paragraphs 28 and 43).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          77 When assets are grouped for recoverability assessments, it is important to include in the cash-generating unit all assets that generate or are used to generate the relevant stream of cash inflows. Otherwise, the cash-generating unit may appear to be fully recoverable when in fact an impairment loss has occurred. In some cases, although some assets contribute to the estimated future cash flows of a cash-generating unit, they cannot be allocated to the cash-generating unit on a reasonable and consistent basis. This might be the case for goodwill or corporate assets such as head office assets. Paragraphs 80–103 explain how to deal with these assets in testing a cash-generating unit for impairment.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          78 It may be necessary to consider some recognised liabilities to determine the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit. This may occur if the disposal of a cash-generating unit would require the buyer to assume the liability. In this case, the fair value less costs of disposal (or the estimated cash flow from ultimate disposal) of the cash-generating unit is the price to sell the assets of the cash- generating unit and the liability together, less the costs of disposal. To perform a meaningful comparison between the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit and its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the liability is deducted in determining both the cash-generating unit’s value in use and its carrying amount.

             A company         operates a mine in a country where legislation requires that the owner         must restore the site on completion of its mining operations. The cost         of restoration includes the replacement of the overburden, which must be         removed before mining operations commence. A provision for the costs to         replace the overburden was recognised as soon as the overburden was         removed. The amount provided was recognised as part of the cost of the         mine and is being depreciated over the mine’s useful life. The         carrying amount of the provision for restoration costs is Rs. 500, which         is equal to the present value of the restoration costs.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The entity is testing the mine for impairment. The cash-generating unit         for the mine is the mine as a whole. The entity has received various         offers to buy the mine at a price of around Rs. 800. This price reflects         the fact that the buyer will assume the obligation to restore the         overburden. Disposal costs for the mine are negligible. The value in use         of the mine is approximately Rs. 1,200, excluding restoration costs. The         carrying amount of the mine is Rs. 1,000.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <i>
              The cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal is Rs.         800. This amount considers restoration costs that have already been         provided for. As a consequence, the value in use for the cash-generating         unit is determined after consideration of the restoration costs and is         estimated to be Rs. 700 (Rs. 1,200 less Rs. 500). The carrying amount of         the cash-generating unit is Rs. 500, which is the carrying amount of the         mine (Rs. 1,000) less the carrying amount of the provision for         restoration costs (Rs. 500). Therefore, the recoverable amount of the         cash-generating unit exceeds its carrying amount.

          79 For practical reasons, the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is sometimes determined after consideration of assets that are not part of the cash- generating unit (for example, receivables or other financial assets) or liabilities that have been recognised (for example, payables, pensions and other provisions). In such cases, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is increased by the carrying amount of those assets and decreased by the carrying amount of those liabilities.

            <br/>
            (b) not be larger than an operating segment as defined by paragraph 5 of Ind AS 108, Operating Segments, before aggregation.
            <br/>
           </b>
           <br/>
           81 Goodwill recognised in a business combination is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets, and often contributes to the cash flows of multiple cash-generating units. Goodwill sometimes cannot be allocated on a non-arbitrary basis to individual cash- generating units, but only to groups of cash-generating units. As a result, the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes sometimes comprises a number of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates, but to which it cannot be allocated. References in paragraphs 83–99 and Appendix C to a cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated should be read as references also to a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           82 Applying the requirements in paragraph 80 results in goodwill being tested for impairment at a level that reflects the way an entity manages its operations and with which the goodwill would naturally be associated. Therefore, the development of additional reporting systems is typically not necessary.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           83 A cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated for the purpose of impairment testing may not coincide with the level at which goodwill is allocated in accordance with Ind AS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, for the purpose of measuring foreign currency gains and losses. For example, if an entity is required by Ind AS 21 to allocate goodwill to relatively low levels for the purpose of measuring foreign currency gains and losses, it is not required to test the goodwill for impairment at that same level unless it also monitors the goodwill at that level for internal management purposes.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           84 If the initial allocation of goodwill acquired in a business combination cannot be completed before the end of the annual period in which the business combination is effected, that initial allocation shall be completed before the end of the first annual period beginning after the acquisition date.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           85 In accordance with Ind AS 103,
           <i>
            Business Combinations
           </i>
           , if the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected, the acquirer:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) accounts for the combination using those provisional values; and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within the measurement period, which will not exceed twelve months from the acquisition date.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In such circumstances, it might also not be possible to complete the initial allocation of the goodwill recognised in the combination before the end of the annual period in which the combination is effected. When this is the case, the entity discloses the information required by paragraph 133.

            86 If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of an operation within that unit, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of shall be:

          87 If an entity reorganises its reporting structure in a way that changes the composition of one or more cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill shall be reallocated to the units affected. This reallocation shall be performed using a relative value approach similar to that used when an entity disposes of an operation within a cash-generating unit, unless the entity can demonstrate that some other method better reflects the goodwill associated with the reorganised units.

Similarly, there may be an indication of an impairment of a cash-generating unit within a group of units containing the goodwill.

           <br/>
           100 Corporate assets include group or divisional assets such as the building of a headquarters or a division of the entity, EDP equipment or a research centre. The structure of an entity determines whether an asset meets this Standard’s definition of corporate assets for a particular cash-generating unit. The distinctive characteristics of corporate assets are that they do not generate cash inflows independently of other assets or groups of assets and their carrying amount cannot be fully attributed to the cash-generating unit under review.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           101 Because corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows, the recoverable amount of an individual corporate asset cannot be determined unless management has decided to dispose of the asset. As a consequence, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, recoverable amount is determined for the cash- generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the corporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of this cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Any impairment loss is recognised in accordance with paragraph 104.

            <br/>
            (a) can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to that unit, the entity shall compare the carrying amount of the unit, including the portion of the carrying amount of the corporate asset allocated to the unit, with its recoverable amount.

           (a) an impairment loss is recognised for the asset if its carrying amount is greater than the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and the results of the allocation procedures described in paragraphs 104 and 105; and

             A machine has suffered         physical damage but is still working, although not as well as before it         was damaged. The machine’s fair value less costs of disposal is less         than its carrying amount. The machine does not generate independent cash         inflows. The smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the         machine and generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the         cash inflows from other assets is the production line to which the         machine belongs. The recoverable amount of the production line shows         that the production line taken as a whole is not impaired.

              The production line is not impaired. Therefore, no impairment loss is         recognised for the machine. Nevertheless, the entity may need to         reassess the depreciation period or the depreciation method for the         machine. Perhaps a shorter depreciation period or a faster depreciation         method is required to reflect the expected remaining useful life of the         machine or the pattern in which economic benefits are expected to be         consumed by the entity.

              The machine’s value in use can be estimated to be close to its fair         value less costs of disposal. Therefore, the recoverable amount of the         machine can be determined and no consideration is given to the         cash-generating unit to which the machine belongs (ie the production         line). Because the machine’s fair value less costs of disposal is less         than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised for the         machine.

           (c) market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have decreased during the period, and those decreases are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating the asset’s value in use and increase the asset’s recoverable amount materially.

          112 Indications of a potential decrease in an impairment loss in paragraph 111 mainly mirror the indications of a potential impairment loss in paragraph 12.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          113 If there is an indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased, this may indicate that the remaining useful life, the depreciation (amortisation) method or the residual value may need to be reviewed and adjusted in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard applicable to the asset, even if no impairment loss is reversed for the asset.

           114 An impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset shall, except as described in paragraph 117, be increased to its recoverable amount. That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss.
          </b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          115 A reversal of an impairment loss reflects an increase in the estimated service potential of an asset, either from use or from sale, since the date when an entity last recognised an impairment loss for that asset. Paragraph 130 requires an entity to identify the change in estimates that causes the increase in estimated service potential. Examples of changes in estimates include:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) a change in the basis for recoverable amount (ie whether recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal or value in use);
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) if recoverable amount was based on value in use, a change in the amount or timing of estimated future cash flows or in the discount rate; or
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) if recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs of disposal, a change in estimate of the components of fair value less costs of disposal.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          116 An asset’s value in use may become greater than the asset’s carrying amount simply because the present value of future cash inflows increases as they become closer. However, the service potential of the asset has not increased. Therefore, an impairment loss is not reversed just because of the passage of time (sometimes called the ‘unwinding’ of the discount), even if the recoverable amount of the asset becomes higher than its carrying amount.

          118 Any increase in the carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill above the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years is a revaluation.

           <br/>
           <br/>
           A1 The following elements together capture the economic differences between assets:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) an estimate of the future cash flow, or in more complex cases, series of future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c) the time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free rate of interest;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (d) the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset; and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (e) other, sometimes unidentifiable, factors (such as illiquidity) that market participants would reflect in pricing the future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A2 This appendix contrasts two approaches to computing present value, either of which may be used to estimate the value in use of an asset, depending on the circumstances. Under the ‘traditional’ approach, adjustments for factors (b)–(e) described in paragraph A1 are embedded in the discount rate. Under the ‘expected cash flow’ approach, factors (b), (d) and (e) cause adjustments in arriving at risk- adjusted expected cash flows. Whichever approach an entity adopts to reflect expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of future cash flows, the result should be to reflect the expected present value of the future cash flows, ie the weighted average of all possible outcomes.

            General principles
            <br/>
           </b>
           <br/>
           A3 The techniques used to estimate future cash flows and interest rates will vary from one situation to another depending on the circumstances surrounding the asset in question. However, the following general principles govern any application of present value techniques in measuring assets:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) interest rates used to discount cash flows should reflect assumptions that are consistent with those inherent in the estimated cash flows. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double-counted or ignored. For example, a discount rate of 12 per cent might be applied to contractual cash flows of a loan receivable. That rate reflects expectations about future defaults from loans with particular characteristics. That same 12 per cent rate should not be used to discount expected cash flows because those cash flows already reflect assumptions about future defaults.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) estimated cash flows and discount rates should be free from both bias and factors unrelated to the asset in question. For example, deliberately understating estimated net cash flows to enhance the apparent future profitability of an asset introduces a bias into the measurement.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c) estimated cash flows or discount rates should reflect the range of possible outcomes rather than a single most likely, minimum or maximum possible amount.

            Traditional approach
            <br/>
           </b>
           <br/>
           A4 Accounting applications of present value have traditionally used a single set of estimated cash flows and a single discount rate, often described as ‘the rate commensurate with the risk’. In effect, the traditional approach assumes that a single discount rate convention can incorporate all the expectations about the future cash flows and the appropriate risk premium. Therefore, the traditional approach places most of the emphasis on selection of the discount rate.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A5 In some circumstances, such as those in which comparable assets can be observed in the marketplace, a traditional approach is relatively easy to apply. For assets with contractual cash flows, it is consistent with the manner in which marketplace participants describe assets, as in ‘a 12 per cent bond’.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           A6 However, the traditional approach may not appropriately address some complex measurement problems, such as the measurement of non-financial assets for which no market for the item or a comparable item exists. A proper search for ‘the rate commensurate with the risk’ requires analysis of at least two items—an asset that exists in the marketplace and has an observed interest rate and the asset being measured. The appropriate discount rate for the cash flows being measured must be inferred from the observable rate of interest in that other asset. To draw that inference, the characteristics of the other asset’s cash flows must be similar to those of the asset being measured. Therefore, the measurer must do the following:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (a) identify the set of cash flows that will be discounted;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (b) identify another asset in the marketplace that appears to have similar cash flow characteristics;
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (c) compare the cash flow sets from the two items to ensure that they are similar (for example, are both sets contractual cash flows, or is one contractual and the other an estimated cash flow?);
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (d) evaluate whether there is an element in one item that is not present in the other (for example, is one less liquid than the other?); and
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (e) evaluate whether both sets of cash flows are likely to behave (ie vary) in a similar fashion in changing economic conditions.
           <br/>

          A7 The expected cash flow approach is, in some situations, a more effective measurement tool than the traditional approach. In developing a measurement, the expected cash flow approach uses all expectations about possible cash flows instead of the single most likely cash flow. For example, a cash flow might be Rs. 100, Rs. 200 or Rs. 300 with probabilities of 10 per cent, 60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. The expected cash flow is Rs. 220. The expected cash flow approach thus differs from the traditional approach by focusing on direct analysis of the cash flows in question and on more explicit statements of the assumptions used in the measurement.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A8 The expected cash flow approach also allows use of present value techniques when the timing of cash flows is uncertain. For example, a cash flow of Rs.. 1,000 may be received in one year, two years or three years with probabilities of 10 per cent, 60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. The example below shows the computation of expected present value in that situation.

          A9 The expected present value of Rs. 892.36 differs from the traditional notion of a best estimate of Rs. 902.73 (the 60 per cent probability). A traditional present value computation applied to this example requires a decision about which of the possible timings of cash flows to use and, accordingly, would not reflect the probabilities of other timings. This is because the discount rate in a traditional present value computation cannot reflect uncertainties in timing.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A10 The use of probabilities is an essential element of the expected cash flow approach. Some question whether assigning probabilities to highly subjective estimates suggests greater precision than, in fact, exists. However, the proper application of the traditional approach (as described in paragraph A6) requires the same estimates and subjectivity without providing the computational transparency of the expected cash flow approach.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A11 Many estimates developed in current practice already incorporate the elements of expected cash flows informally. In addition, accountants often face the need to measure an asset using limited information about the probabilities of possible cash flows. For example, an accountant might be confronted with the following situations:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) the estimated amount falls somewhere between Rs. 50 and Rs. 250, but no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount. Based on that limited information, the estimated expected cash flow is Rs. 150 [(50 + 250)/2].
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) the estimated amount falls somewhere between Rs. 50 and Rs. 250, and the most likely amount is Rs. 100. However, the probabilities attached to each amount are unknown. Based on that limited information, the estimated expected cash flow is Rs. 133.33 [(50 + 100 + 250)/3].
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (c) the estimated amount will be Rs. 50 (10 per cent probability), Rs. 250 (30 per cent probability), or Rs. 100 (60 per cent probability). Based on that limited information, the estimated expected cash flow is Rs. 140 [(50 × 0.10) + (250 × 0.30) + (100 × 0.60)].
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In each case, the estimated expected cash flow is likely to provide a better estimate of value in use than the minimum, most likely or maximum amount taken alone.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A12 The application of an expected cash flow approach is subject to a cost-benefit constraint. In some cases, an entity may have access to extensive data and may be able to develop many cash flow scenarios. In other cases, an entity may not be able to develop more than general statements about the variability of cash flows without incurring substantial cost. The entity needs to balance the cost of obtaining additional information against the additional reliability that information will bring to the measurement.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A13 Some maintain that expected cash flow techniques are inappropriate for measuring a single item or an item with a limited number of possible outcomes. They offer an example of an asset with two possible outcomes: a 90 per cent probability that the cash flow will be Rs. 10 and a 10 per cent probability that the cash flow will be Rs. 1,000. They observe that the expected cash flow in that example is Rs. 109 and criticise that result as not representing either of the amounts that may ultimately be paid.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A14 Assertions like the one just outlined reflect underlying disagreement with the measurement objective. If the objective is accumulation of costs to be incurred, expected cash flows may not produce a representationally faithful estimate of the expected cost. However, this Standard is concerned with measuring the recoverable amount of an asset. The recoverable amount of the asset in this example is not likely to be Rs. 10, even though that is the most likely cash flow. This is because a measurement of Rs. 10 does not incorporate the uncertainty of the cash flow in the measurement of the asset. Instead, the uncertain cash flow is presented as if it were a certain cash flow. No rational entity would sell an asset with these characteristics for Rs. 10.

         <font face="Arial" size="2">
          A15 Whichever approach an entity adopts for measuring the value in use of an asset, interest rates used to discount cash flows should not reflect risks for which the estimated cash flows have been adjusted. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double-counted.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A16 When an asset-specific rate is not directly available from the market, an entity uses surrogates to estimate the discount rate. The purpose is to estimate, as far as possible, a market assessment of:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) the time value of money for the periods until the end of the asset’s useful life; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) factors (b), (d) and (e) described in paragraph A1, to the extent those factors have not caused adjustments in arriving at estimated cash flows.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A17 As a starting point in making such an estimate, the entity might take into account the following rates:
          <br/>
          (a) the entity’s weighted average cost of capital determined using techniques such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model;
          <br/>
          (b) the entity’s incremental borrowing rate; and
          <br/>
          (c) other market borrowing rates.
         </font>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         <font face="Arial" size="2">
          A18 However, these rates must be adjusted:
          <br/>
          (a) to reflect the way that the market would assess the specific risks associated with the asset’s estimated cash flows; and
          <br/>
          (b) to exclude risks that are not relevant to the asset’s estimated cash flows or for which the estimated cash flows have been adjusted.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Consideration should be given to risks such as country risk, currency risk and price risk.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A19 The discount rate is independent of the entity’s capital structure and the way the entity financed the purchase of the asset, because the future cash flows expected to arise from an asset do not depend on the way in which the entity financed the purchase of the asset.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A20 Paragraph 55 requires the discount rate used to be a pre-tax rate. Therefore, when the basis used to estimate the discount rate is post-tax, that basis is adjusted to reflect a pre-tax rate.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A21 An entity normally uses a single discount rate for the estimate of an asset’s value in use. However, an entity uses separate discount rates for different future periods where value in use is sensitive to a difference in risks for different periods or to the term structure of interest rates.

           C4 If an entity measures non-controlling interests as its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of a subsidiary at the acquisition date, rather than at fair value, goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests is included in the recoverable amount of the related cash-generating unit but is not recognised in the parent’s consolidated financial statements. As a consequence, an entity shall gross up the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest. This adjusted carrying amount is then compared with the recoverable amount of the unit to determine whether the cash- generating unit is impaired.

          C5 Paragraph 104 requires any identified impairment loss to be allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          C6 If a subsidiary, or part of a subsidiary, with a non-controlling interest is itself a cash-generating unit, the impairment loss is allocated between the parent and the non-controlling interest on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          C7 If a subsidiary, or part of a subsidiary, with a non-controlling interest is part of a larger cash-generating unit, goodwill impairment losses are allocated to the parts of the cash-generating unit that have a non-controlling interest and the parts that do not. The impairment losses should be allocated to the parts of the cash- generating unit on the basis of:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (a) to the extent that the impairment relates to goodwill in the cash-generating unit, the relative carrying values of the goodwill of the parts before the impairment; and
          <br/>
          <br/>
          (b) to the extent that the impairment relates to identifiable assets in the cash- generating unit, the relative carrying values of the net identifiable assets of the parts before the impairment. Any such impairment is allocated to the assets of the parts of each unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the part.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In those parts that have a non-controlling interest, the impairment loss is allocated between the parent and the non-controlling interest on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          C8 If an impairment loss attributable to a non-controlling interest relates to goodwill that is not recognised in the parent’s consolidated financial statements (see paragraph C4), that impairment is not recognised as a goodwill impairment loss. In such cases, only the impairment loss relating to the goodwill that is allocated to the parent is recognised as a goodwill impairment loss.

            Comparison with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets
            <br/>
           </b>
           <br/>
           1 Paragraph 2(f) is deleted in Ind AS 36 as Ind AS 40 requires cost model. To maintain consistency with IAS 36, this paragraph number has been retained. Further, for this reason, paragraph 5 of Ind AS 36 has been modified by deleting reference to fair value measurement of investment property..
           <br/>
           <br/>
           2 The transitional provisions given in IAS 36 have not been given in Ind AS 36, since all transitional provisions related to Ind ASs, wherever considered appropriate have been included in Ind AS 101,
           <i>
            First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards

           3. Different terminology is used, as used in existing laws eg, the term ‘balance sheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’ and ‘Statement of profit and loss’ is used instead of ‘Statement of comprehensive income’.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           4 Following Paragraphs have been deleted as a consequence of Ind AS 113,
           <i>
            Fair Value Measurement.
           </i>
           However, the paragraph numbering has been retained to make it consistent with paragraph numbering of IAS 36:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           (i). Paragraph 5(b) (ii). Paragraphs 25-27
           <br/>
           <br/>
           5 Paragraphs 91-95 appear as ‘Deleted’ in IAS 36. In order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 36, the paragraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 36.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           6 Following references to Illustrative Examples which are not integral part of IAS 36 have not been included in Ind AS 36:

           7 Following paragraphs making references to Illustrative examples which are not integral part of IAS 36 have been deleted in Ind AS 36. The paragraph numbers have been retained in Ind AS 36 in order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 36:
