          5 This Standard uses terminology that is suitable for profit-oriented entities, including public sector business entities. If entities with not-for-profit activities in the private sector or the public sector apply this Standard, they may need to amend the descriptions used for particular line items in the financial statements and for the financial statements themselves.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          6 Similarly, entities whose share capital is not equity may need to adapt the financial statement presentation of members’ interests.

          Many existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to provide information directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial information they need.

Financial statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At times, even wellinformed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand information about complex economic phenomena.]

          9 Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions. Financial statements also show the results of the management’s stewardship of the resources entrusted to it. To meet this objective, financial statements provide information about an entity’s:
          <br/>
          (a) assets;
          <br/>
          (b) liabilities;
          <br/>
          (c) equity;
          <br/>
          (d) income and expenses, including gains and losses;
          <br/>
          (e) contributions by and distributions to owners in their capacity as owners; and
          <br/>
          (f) cash flows.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This information, along with other information in the notes, assists users of financial statements in predicting the entity’s future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty.

When assessing whether complying with a specific requirement in an Ind AS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in the Framework, management considers:

          (a) why the objective of financial statements is not achieved in the particular circumstances; and

When management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, the entity shall disclose those uncertainties.

The degree of consideration depends on the facts in each case. When an entity has a history of profitable operations and ready access to financial resources, the entity may reach a conclusion that the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate without detailed analysis. In other cases, management may need to consider a wide range of factors relating to current and expected profitability, debt repayment schedules and potential sources of replacement financing before it can satisfy itself that the going concern basis is appropriate.

For example, an entity discloses in the current period details of a legal dispute, the outcome of which was uncertain at the end of the preceding period and is yet to be resolved. Users may benefit from the disclosure of information that the uncertainty existed at the end of the preceding period and from the disclosure of information about the steps that have been taken during the period to resolve the uncertainty.

          38C An entity may present comparative information in addition to the minimum comparative financial statements required by Ind ASs, as long as that information is prepared in accordance with Ind ASs. This comparative information may consist of one or more statements referred to in paragraph 10, but need not comprise a complete set of financial statements.

An entity changes the presentation of its financial statements only if the changed presentation provides information that is reliable and more relevant to users of the financial statements and the revised structure is likely to continue, so that comparability is not impaired. When making such changes in presentation, an entity reclassifies its comparative information in accordance with paragraphs 41 and 42.

          57 This Standard does not prescribe the order or format in which an entity presents items. Paragraph 54 simply lists items that are sufficiently different in nature or function to warrant separate presentation in the balance sheet. In addition:
          <br/>
          (a) line items are included when the size, nature or function of an item or aggregation of similar items is such that separate presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial position; and
          <br/>
          (b) the descriptions used and the ordering of items or aggregation of similar items may be amended according to the nature of the entity and its transactions, to provide information that is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial position. For example, a financial institution may amend the above descriptions to provide information that is relevant to the operations of a financial institution.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          58  An entity makes the judgement about whether to present additional items separately on the basis of an assessment of:
          <br/>
          (a) the nature and liquidity of assets;
          <br/>
          (b) the function of assets within the entity; and

          <br/>
          <br/>
          59  The use of different measurement bases for different classes of assets suggests that their nature or function differs and, therefore, that an entity presents them as separate line items. For example, different classes of property, plant and equipment can be carried at cost or at revalued amounts in accordance with Ind AS 16.

          62 When an entity supplies goods or services within a clearly identifiable operating cycle, separate classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities in the balance sheet provides useful information by distinguishing the net assets that are continuously circulating as working capital from those used in the entity’s long-term operations. It also highlights assets that are expected to be realised within the current operating cycle, and liabilities that are due for settlement within the same period.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          63 For some entities, such as financial institutions, a presentation of assets and liabilities in increasing or decreasing order of liquidity provides information that is reliable and more relevant than a current/non-current presentation because the entity does not supply goods or services within a clearly identifiable operating cycle.

          64 In applying paragraph 60, an entity is permitted to present some of its assets and liabilities using a current/non-current classification and others in order of liquidity when this provides information that is reliable and more relevant. The need for a mixed basis of presentation might arise when an entity has diverse operations.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          65 Information about expected dates of realisation of assets and liabilities is useful in assessing the liquidity and solvency of an entity. Ind AS 107,

          requires disclosure of the maturity dates of financial assets and financial liabilities. Financial assets include trade and other receivables, and financial liabilities include trade and other payables. Information on the expected date of recovery of non-monetary assets such as inventories and expected date of settlement for liabilities such as provisions is also useful, whether assets and liabilities are classified as current or as non- current. For example, an entity discloses the amount of inventories that are expected to be recovered more than twelve months after the reporting period.

          67 This Standard uses the term ‘non-current’ to include tangible, intangible and financial assets of a long-term nature. It does not prohibit the use of alternative descriptions as long as the meaning is clear.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          68 The operating cycle of an entity is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents. When the entity’s normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be twelve months. Current assets include assets (such as inventories and trade receivables) that are sold, consumed or realised as part of the normal operating cycle even when they are not expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period. Current assets also include assets held primarily for the purpose of trading (examples include some financial assets that meet the definition of held for trading in Ind AS 109) and the current portion of non- current financial assets.

          70 Some current liabilities, such as trade payables and some accruals for employee and other operating costs, are part of the working capital used in the entity’s normal operating cycle. An entity classifies such operating items as current liabilities even if they are due to be settled more than twelve months after the reporting period. The same normal operating cycle applies to the classification of an entity’s assets and liabilities. When the entity’s normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be twelve months.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          71 Other current liabilities are not settled as part of the normal operating cycle, but are due for settlement within twelve months after the reporting period or held primarily for the purpose of trading. Examples are some financial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading in Ind AS 109, bank overdrafts, and the current portion of non-current financial liabilities, dividends payable, income taxes and other non-trade payables. Financial liabilities that provide financing on a long-term basis (ie are not part of the working capital used in the entity’s normal operating cycle) and are not due for settlement within twelve months after the reporting period are non-current liabilities, subject to paragraphs 74 and 75.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          72 An entity classifies its financial liabilities as current when they are due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, even if:
          <br/>
          (a) the original term was for a period longer than twelve months, and
          <br/>
          (b) an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the reporting period and before the financial statements are approved for issue.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          73 If an entity expects, and has the discretion, to refinance or roll over an obligation for at least twelve months after the reporting period under an existing loan facility, it classifies the obligation as non-current, even if it would otherwise be due within a shorter period. However, when refinancing or rolling over the obligation is not at the discretion of the entity (for example, there is no arrangement for refinancing), the entity does not consider the potential to refinance the obligation and classifies the obligation as current.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          74 Where there is a breach of a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end of the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the entity does not classify the liability as current, if the lender agreed, after the reporting period and before the approval of the financial statements for issue, not to demand payment as a consequence of the breach.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          75 However, an entity classifies the liability as non-current if the lender agreed by the end of the reporting period to provide a period of grace ending at least
          <br/>
          <br/>
          twelve months after the reporting period, within which the entity can rectify the breach and during which the lender cannot demand immediate repayment.

          86 Because the effects of an entity’s various activities, transactions and other events differ in frequency, potential for gain or loss and predictability, disclosing the components of financial performance assists users in understanding the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future financial performance. An entity includes additional line items in the statement of profit and loss, and it amends the descriptions used and the ordering of items when this is necessary to explain the elements of financial performance. An entity considers factors including materiality and the nature and function of the items of income and expense. For example, a financial institution may amend the descriptions to provide information that is relevant to the operations of a financial institution. An entity does not offset income and expense items unless the criteria in paragraph 32 are met.

          93 Other Ind ASs specify whether and when amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. Such reclassifications are referred to in this Standard as reclassification adjustments. A reclassification adjustment is included with the related component of other comprehensive income in the period that the adjustment is reclassified to profit or loss. These amounts may have been recognised in other comprehensive income as unrealised gains in the current or previous periods. Those unrealised gains must be deducted from other comprehensive income in the period in which the realised gains are reclassified to profit or loss to avoid including them in total comprehensive income twice.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          94 An entity may present reclassification adjustments in the statement of profit and loss or in the notes. An entity presenting reclassification adjustments in the notes presents the items of other comprehensive income after any related reclassification adjustments.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          95 Reclassification adjustments arise, for example, on disposal of a foreign operation (see Ind AS 21) and when some hedged forecast cash flow affect profit or loss (see paragraph 6.5.11(d) of Ind AS109 in relation to cash flow hedges).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          96 Reclassification adjustments do not arise on changes in revaluation surplus recognised in accordance with Ind AS 16 or Ind AS 38 or on reameasurements of defined benefit plans recognised in accordance with Ind AS 19. These components are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Changes in revaluation surplus may be transferred to retained earnings in subsequent periods as the asset is used or when it is derecognised (see Ind AS 16 and Ind AS 38). In accordance with Ind AS 109, reclassification adjustments do not arise if a cash flow hedge or the accounting for the time value of an option (or the forward element of a forward contract or the foreign currency basis spread of a financial instrument) result in amounts that are removed from the cash flow hedge reserve or a separate component of equity, respectively, and included directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of an asset or a liability. These amounts are directly transferred to assets or liabilities.

          101 Expenses are subclassified to highlight components of financial performance that may differ in terms of frequency, potential for gain or loss and predictability. This analysis is provided in the form as described in paragraph 102.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          102 In the analysis based on the ‘nature of expense’ method, an entity aggregates expenses within profit or loss according to their nature (for example, depreciation, purchases of materials, transport costs, employee benefits and advertising costs), and does not reallocate them among functions within the entity. This method is simple to apply because no allocations of expenses to functional classifications are necessary. An example of a classification using the nature of expense method is as follows:

          109 Changes in an entity’s equity between the beginning and the end of the reporting period reflect the increase or decrease in its net assets during the period. Except for changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners (such as equity contributions, reacquisitions of the entity’s own equity instruments and dividends) and transaction costs directly related to such transactions, the overall change in equity during a period represents the total amount of income and expense, including gains and losses, generated by the entity’s activities during that period.

Ind AS 8 also requires restatements to correct errors to be made retrospectively, to the extent practicable. Retrospective adjustments and retrospective restatements are not changes in equity but they are adjustments to the opening balance of retained earnings, except when an Ind AS requires retrospective adjustment of another component of equity. Paragraph 106(b) requires disclosure in the statement of changes in equity of the total adjustment to each component of equity resulting from changes in accounting policies and, separately, from corrections of errors. These adjustments are disclosed for each prior period and the beginning of the period.

Each entity considers the nature of its operations and the policies that the users of its financial statements w o u l d expect to be disclosed for that type of entity. Disclosure of particular accounting policies is especially useful to users when those policies are selected from alternatives allowed in Ind ASs. An example is disclosure of a regular way purchase or sale of financial assets using either trade date accounting or settlement date accounting (see Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments).

          125 An entity shall disclose information about the assumptions it makes about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. In respect of those assets and liabilities, the notes shall include details of:
          <br/>
          (a) their nature, and
          <br/>
          (b) their carrying amount as at the end of the reporting period.

          <br/>
          <br/>
          126 Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. For example, in the absence of recently observed market prices, future-oriented estimates are necessary to measure the recoverable amount of classes of property, plant and equipment, the effect of technological obsolescence on inventories, provisions subject to the future outcome of litigation in progress, and long-term employee benefit liabilities such as pension obligations. These estimates involve assumptions about such items as the risk adjustment to cash flows or discount rates, future changes in salaries and future changes in prices affecting other costs.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          127 The assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty disclosed in accordance with paragraph 125 relate to the estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increases, those judgements become more subjective and complex, and the potential for a consequential material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities normally increases accordingly.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          128 The disclosures in paragraph 125 are not required for assets and liabilities with a significant risk that their carrying amounts might change materially within the next financial year if, at the end of the reporting period, they are measured at fair value based on a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability. Such fair values might change materially within the next financial year but these changes would not arise from assumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          129 An entity presents the disclosures in paragraph 125 in a manner that helps users of financial statements to understand the judgements that management makes about the future and about other sources of estimation uncertainty. The nature and extent of the information provided vary according to the nature of the assumption and other circumstances. Examples of the types of disclosures an entity makes are:
          <br/>
          (a) the nature of the assumption or other estimation uncertainty;
          <br/>
          (b) the sensitivity of carrying amounts to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying their calculation, including the reasons for the sensitivity;
          <br/>
          (c) the expected resolution of an uncertainty and the range of reasonably possible outcomes within the next financial year in respect of the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities affected; and
          <br/>
          (d) an explanation of changes made to past assumptions concerning those assets and liabilities, if the uncertainty remains unresolved.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          130 This Standard does not require an entity to disclose budget information or forecasts in making the disclosures in paragraph 125.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          131 Sometimes it is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of an assumption or another source of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period. In such cases, the entity discloses that it is reasonably possible, on the basis of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year that are different from the assumption could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected. In all cases, the entity discloses the nature and carrying amount of the specific asset or liability (or class of assets or liabilities) affected by the assumption.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          132 The disclosures in paragraph 122 of particular judgements that management made in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies do not relate to the disclosures of sources of estimation uncertainty in paragraph 125.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          133 Other Ind ASs require the disclosure of some of the assumptions that would otherwise be required in accordance with paragraph 125. For example, Ind AS 37 requires disclosure, in specified circumstances, of major assumptions concerning future events affecting classes of provisions. Ind AS 113,

          <br/>
          (iii) how it is meeting its objectives for managing capital.
          <br/>
          (b) summary quantitative data about what it manages as capital. Some entities regard some financial liabilities (eg some forms of subordinated debt) as part of capital. Other entities regard capital as excluding some components of equity (eg components arising from cash flow hedges).
          <br/>
          (c) any changes in (a) and (b) from the previous period.
          <br/>

          <br/>
          136 An entity may manage capital in a number of ways and be subject to a number of different capital requirements. For example, a conglomerate may include entities that undertake insurance activities and banking activities and those entities may operate in several jurisdictions. When an aggregate disclosure of capital requirements and how capital is managed would not provide useful information or distorts a financial statement user’s understanding of an entity’s capital resources, the entity shall disclose separate information for each capital requirement to which the entity is subject.

          Note: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose of this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 1 and the corresponding International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

          1. With regard to preparation of Statement of profit and loss, International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1,

          Presentation of Financial Statements

          , provides an option either to follow the single statement approach or to follow the two statement approach. Paragraph 10A of IAS 1 provides that an entity may present a single statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, with profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented in two sections or an entity may present the profit or loss section in a separate statement of profit or loss which shall immediately precede the statement presenting comprehensive income, which shall begin with profit or loss. Ind AS 1 allows only the single statement approach. Accordingly paragraph 10A has been modified.

        <p class="cs8A91EFFA">
         <span class="csA16174BA">
          2. Different terminology is used in Ind AS 1 eg, the term ‘balance sheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’ and ‘Statement of Profit and Loss’ is used instead of ‘Statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income’. The words ‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead of ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of financial statements considered for the purpose of events after the reporting period. The words ‘true and fair view’ have been used instead of ‘fair presentation’.

        <p class="cs8A91EFFA">
         <span class="csA16174BA">
          3. Paragraph 8 of IAS 1 gives the option to individual entities to follow different terminology for the titles of financial statements. Ind AS 1 is changed to remove alternatives by giving one terminology to be used by all entities. However, paragraph number 8 has been retained in Ind AS 1 to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 1. Similar changes has been made in paragraph 10 also.

          4. Paragraph 37 of IAS 1 permits the periodicity, for example, of 52 weeks for preparation of financial statements. As Ind AS 1 does not permit it, the same is deleted. However, paragraph number 37 has been retained in Ind AS 1 to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 1.

Ind AS 1 requires only nature-wise classification of expenses. In IAS 1 the following paragraphs are with reference to function-wise classification of expense. In order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 1, the paragraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 1:

          Many existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to provide information directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial information they need. Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose financial statements are directed. Financial statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At times, even wellinformed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand information about complex economic phenomena.
