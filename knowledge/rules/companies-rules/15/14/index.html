The principal issues in accounting for property, plant and equipment are the recognition of the assets, the determination of their carrying amounts and the depreciation charges and impairment losses to be recognised in relation to them.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Scope<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">2 This Standard shall be applied in accounting for property, plant and equipment except when another Standard requires or permits a different accounting treatment.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>3 This Standard does not apply to:<br><br>(a) property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105, </span><span class="csD007A21A">Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>(b) biological assets related to agricultural activity other than bearer plants (See Ind AS 41, </span><span class="csD007A21A">Agriculture</span><span class="csA16174BA">).

Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment are recognised in accordance with this Ind AS when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment. Otherwise, such items are classified as inventory.<br><br>9 This Standard does not prescribe the unit of measure for recognition, ie what constitutes an item of property, plant and equipment. Thus, judgement is required in applying the recognition criteria to an entity’s specific circumstances. It may be appropriate to aggregate individually insignificant items, such as moulds, tools and dies, and to apply the criteria to the aggregate value.</span></p><p class="csC4290383"><span class="cs1996077C"><sup></sup></span><a class="csEC80D8B8" href="#MCAp"><span class="cs48129E1B"><sup>p</sup></span></a><span class="cs1996077C">[10. An entity evaluates under this recognition principle all its property, plant and equipment costs at the time they are incurred. These costs include costs incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of property, plant and equipment and costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment may include costs incurred relating to leases of assets that are used to construct, add to, replace part of or service an item of property, plant and equipment, such as depreciation of right-of-use assets.]</span></p><p class="cs587AD28F"><span class="cs5E98E930">Initial costs<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>11 Items of property, plant and equipment may be acquired for safety or environmental reasons. The acquisition of such property, plant and equipment, although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for an entity to obtain the future economic benefits from its other assets. Such items of property, plant and equipment qualify for recognition as assets because they enable an entity to derive future economic benefits from related assets in excess of what could be derived had those items not been acquired. For example, a chemical manufacturer may install new chemical handling processes to comply with environmental requirements for the production and storage of dangerous chemicals; related plant enhancements are recognised as an asset because without them the entity is unable to manufacture and sell chemicals. However, the resulting carrying amount of such an asset and related assets is reviewed for impairment in accordance with Ind AS 36, Impairment of Assets.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Subsequent costs<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>12 Under the recognition principle in paragraph 7, an entity does not recognise in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the costs of the day- to-day servicing of the item. Rather, these costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Costs of day-to-day servicing are primarily the costs of labour and consumables, and may include the cost of small parts. The purpose of these expenditures is often described as for the ‘repairs and maintenance’ of the item of property, plant and equipment.<br><br>13 Parts of some items of property, plant and equipment may require replacement at regular intervals. For example, a furnace may require relining after a specified number of hours of use, or aircraft interiors such as seats and galleys may require replacement several times during the life of the airframe. Items of property, plant and equipment may also be acquired to make a less frequently recurring replacement, such as replacing the interior walls of a building, or to make a nonrecurring replacement. Under the recognition principle in paragraph 7, an entity recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition provisions of this Standard (see paragraphs 67–72).<br><br>14 A condition of continuing to operate an item of property, plant and equipment (for example, an aircraft) may be performing regular major inspections for faults regardless of whether parts of the item are replaced. When each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised. This occurs regardless of whether the cost of the previous inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or constructed. If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or constructed.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Measurement at recognition<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">15 An item of property, plant and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset shall be measured at its cost.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Elements of cost<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>16 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:<br><br>(a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates.<br><br>(b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.<br><br>(c) the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.<br><br>17 Examples of directly attributable costs are:<br><br>(a) costs of employee benefits (as defined in Ind AS 19, Employee Benefits) arising directly from the construction or acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment;<br><br>(b) costs of site preparation;<br><br>(c) initial delivery and handling costs;<br><br>(d) installation and assembly costs;<br><br><a class="csAC6AF41D" href="#standard6_y"><span class="cs48129E1B"><sup>y</sup></span></a></span><span class="cs463A72F7">[(e) costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, after deducting the net proceeds from selling any items produced while bringing the asset to that location and condition (such as samples produced when testing equipment).

The obligations for costs accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 2 or Ind AS 16 are recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 37, </span><span class="csD007A21A">Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>19 Examples of costs that are not costs of an item of property, plant and equipment are:<br><br>(a) costs of opening a new facility;<br><br>(b) costs of introducing a new product or service (including costs of advertising and promotional activities);<br><br>(c) costs of conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer (including costs of staff training); and<br><br>(d) administration and other general overhead costs.<br><br>20 Recognition of costs in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment ceases when the item is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Therefore, costs incurred in using or redeploying an item are not included in the carrying amount of that item. For example, the following costs are not included in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment:<br><br>(a) costs incurred while an item capable of operating in the manner intended by management has yet to be brought into use or is operated at less than full capacity;<br><br>(b) initial operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the item’s output builds up; and<br><br>(c) costs of relocating or reorganising part or all of an entity’s operations.<br><br>21 Some operations occur in connection with the construction or development of an item of property, plant and equipment, but are not necessary to bring the item to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. These incidental operations may occur before or during the construction or development activities. For example, income may be earned through using a building site as a car park until construction starts. Because incidental operations are not necessary to bring an item to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the income and related expenses of incidental operations are recognised in profit or loss and included in their respective classifications of income and expense.<br><br>22 The cost of a self-constructed asset is determined using the same principles as for an acquired asset. If an entity makes similar assets for sale in the normal course of business, the cost of the asset is usually the same as the cost of constructing an asset for sale (see Ind AS 2). Therefore, any internal profits are eliminated in arriving at such costs. Similarly, the cost of abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour, or other resources incurred in self-constructing an asset is not included in the cost of the asset. Ind AS 23, Borrowing Costs, establishes criteria for the recognition of interest as a component of the carrying amount of a self- constructed item of property, plant and equipment.<br><br>22A&nbsp; Bearer plants are accounted for in the same way as self-constructed items of property, plant and equipment before they are in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Consequently, references to ‘construction’ in this Standard should be read as covering activities that are necessary to cultivate the bearer plants before they are in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Measurement of cost</span></p><p class="cs587AD28F"><span class="csA16174BA">23 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is the cash price equivalent at the recognition date. If payment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the difference between the cash price equivalent and the total payment is recognised as interest over the period of credit unless such interest is capitalised in accordance with Ind AS 23.<br><br>24 One or more items of property, plant and equipment may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a combination of monetary and non- monetary assets. The following discussion refers simply to an exchange of one non-monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding sentence. The cost of such an item of property, plant and equipment is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. The acquired item is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up. If the acquired item is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.<br><br>25 An entity determines whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance by considering the extent to which its future cash flows are expected to change as a result of the transaction. An exchange transaction has commercial substance if:<br><br>(a) the configuration (risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received differs from the configuration of the cash flows of the asset transferred; or<br><br>(b) the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity’s operations affected by the transaction changes as a result of the exchange; and<br><br>(c) the difference in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets exchanged.<br><br>For the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity’s operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash flows. The result of these analyses may be clear without an entity having to perform detailed calculations.<br><br>26 The fair value of an asset is reliably measurable if (a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value measurements is not significant for that asset or (b) the probabilities of the various estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and used when measuring fair value. If an entity is able to measure reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given up is used to measure the cost of the asset received unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident.<br><br></span><span class="cs82E10CDE"><sup></sup></span><a class="cs82E10CDE" href="#MCAe"><span class="csE5B9FBFE"><sup>q</sup></span></a><span class="cs82E10CDE">[27 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment held by a lessee under a finance lease is determined in accordance with Ind AS 17</span><span class="csA16174BA">.]<br><br>28&nbsp;</span><span class="cs1996077C">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs1996077C"><sup></sup></span><a class="csEC80D8B8" href="#MCAl"><span class="cs48129E1B"><sup>l</sup></span></a><span class="cs1996077C">[The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment may be reduced by Government grants in accordance with Ind AS 20,&nbsp;</span><span class="cs38AE4B78">Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance.]</span></p><p class="cs587AD28F"><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Measurement after recognition<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">29 An entity shall choose either the cost model in paragraph 30 or the revaluation model in paragraph 31 as its accounting policy and shall apply that policy to an entire class of property, plant and equipment.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Cost model<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">30 After recognition as an asset, an item of property, plant and equipment shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Revaluation model<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">31 After recognition as an asset, an item of property, plant and equipment whose fair value can be measured reliably shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

When the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially from its carrying amount, a further revaluation is required. Some items of property, plant and equipment experience significant and volatile changes in fair value, thus necessitating annual revaluation. Such frequent revaluations are unnecessary for items of property, plant and equipment with only insignificant changes in fair value. Instead, it may be necessary to revalue the item only every three or five years.<br><br>35 When an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued, the carrying amount of that asset is adjusted to the revalued amount. At the date of the revaluation, the asset is treated in one of the following ways:<br><br>(a) the gross carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount of the asset. For example, the gross carrying amount may be restated by reference to observable market data or it may be restated proportionately to the change in the carrying amount. The accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount of the asset after taking into account accumulated impairment losses; or<br><br>(b) the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.<br><br>The amount of the adjustment of accumulated depreciation forms part of the increase or decrease in carrying amount that is accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 39 and 40.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">36 If an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued, the entire class of property, plant and equipment to which that asset belongs shall be revalued.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>37 A class of property, plant and equipment is a grouping of assets of a similar nature and use in an entity’s operations.

Repair and maintenance of an asset do not negate the need to depreciate it.<br><br>53 The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value. In practice, the residual value of an asset is often insignificant and therefore immaterial in the calculation of the depreciable amount.<br><br>54 The residual value of an asset may increase to an amount equal to or greater than the asset’s carrying amount. If it does, the asset’s depreciation charge is zero unless and until its residual value subsequently decreases to an amount below the asset’s carrying amount.<br><br>55 Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with Ind AS 105 and the date that the asset is derecognised. Therefore, depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. However, under usage methods of depreciation the depreciation charge can be zero while there is no production.<br><br>56 The future economic benefits embodied in an asset are consumed by an entity principally through its use. However, other factors, such as technical or commercial obsolescence and wear and tear while an asset remains idle, often result in the diminution of the economic benefits that might have been obtained from the asset. Consequently, all the following factors are considered in determining the useful life of an asset:<br><br>(a) expected usage of the asset. Usage is assessed by reference to the asset’s expected capacity or physical output.<br><br>(b) expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors such as the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used and the repair and maintenance programme, and the care and maintenance of the asset while idle.<br><br>(c) technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in production, or from a change in the market demand for the product or service output of the asset. Expected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.<br><br>(d) legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of related leases.<br><br>57 The useful life of an asset is defined in terms of the asset’s expected utility to the entity. The asset management policy of the entity may involve the disposal of assets after a specified time or after consumption of a specified proportion of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Therefore, the useful life of an asset may be shorter than its economic life. The estimation of the useful life of the asset is a matter of judgement based on the experience of the entity with similar assets.<br><br>58 Land and buildings are separable assets and are accounted for separately, even when they are acquired together. With some exceptions, such as quarries and sites used for landfill, land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Buildings have a limited useful life and therefore are depreciable assets. An increase in the value of the land on which a building stands does not affect the determination of the depreciable amount of the building.<br><br>59 If the cost of land includes the costs of site dismantlement, removal and restoration, that portion of the land asset is depreciated over the period of benefits obtained by incurring those costs.

These methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing balance method and the units of production method. Straight-line depreciation results in a constant charge over the useful life if the asset’s residual value does not change. The diminishing balance method results in a decreasing charge over the useful life. The units of production method results in a charge based on the expected use or output. The entity selects the method that most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. That method is applied consistently from period to period unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.<br><br>62A&nbsp;&nbsp; A depreciation method that is based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate. The revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits of the asset. For example, revenue is affected by other inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales volumes and prices.

If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.<br><br>(c) if the adjustment results in an addition to the cost of an asset, the entity shall consider whether this is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. If it is such an indication, the entity shall test the asset for impairment by estimating its recoverable amount, and shall account for any impairment loss, in accordance with Ind AS 36.<br><br>6 If the related asset is measured using the revaluation model:<br><br>(a) changes in the liability alter the revaluation surplus or deficit previously recognised on that asset, so that:<br><br>(i) a decrease in the liability shall (subject to (b)) be recognised in other comprehensive income and increase the revaluation surplus within equity, except that it shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit on the asset that was previously recognised in profit or loss;<br><br>(ii) an increase in the liability shall be recognised in profit or loss, except that it shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and reduce the revaluation surplus within equity to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.<br><br>(b) in the event that a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the asset been carried under the cost model, the excess shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.<br><br>(c) a change in the liability is an indication that the asset may have to be revalued in order to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. Any such revaluation shall be taken into account in determining the amounts to be recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income under (a). If a revaluation is necessary, all assets of that class shall be revalued.<br><br>(d) Ind AS 1 requires disclosure in the statement of profit and loss of each component of other comprehensive income or expense. In complying with this requirement, the change in the revaluation surplus arising from a change in the liability shall be separately identified and disclosed as such.<br><br>7 The adjusted depreciable amount of the asset is depreciated over its useful life. Therefore, once the related asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes in the liability shall be recognised in profit or loss as they occur.

In surface mining operations, entities may find it necessary to remove mine waste materials (‘overburden’) to gain access to mineral ore deposits. This waste removal activity is known as ‘stripping’.<br><br>2. During the development phase of the mine (before production begins), stripping costs are usually capitalised as part of the depreciable cost of building, developing and constructing the mine. Those capitalised costs are depreciated or amortised on a systematic basis, usually by using the units of production method, once production begins.<br><br>3. A mining entity may continue to remove overburden and to incur stripping costs during the production phase of the mine.<br><br>4. The material removed when stripping in the production phase will not necessarily be a total waste; often it will be a combination of ore and waste. The ratio of ore to waste can range from uneconomic low grade to profitable high grade. Removal of material with a low ratio of ore to waste may produce some usable material, which can be used to produce inventory. This removal might also provide access to deeper levels of material that have a higher ratio of ore to waste. There can therefore be two benefits accruing to the entity from the stripping activity: usable ore that can be used to produce inventory and improved access to further quantities of material that will be mined in future periods.<br><br>5. This Appendix considers when and how to account separately for these two benefits arising from the stripping activity, as well as how to measure these benefits both initially and subsequently.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Scope&nbsp;<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>6.

This Appendix addresses the following issues:<br><br>(a) recognition of production stripping costs as an asset;<br><br>(b) initial measurement of the stripping activity asset; and<br><br>(c) subsequent measurement of the stripping activity asset.<br><br></span><span class="cs32645C0C">Accounting Principles</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Recognition of production stripping costs as an asset<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>8. To the extent that the benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory produced, the entity shall account for the costs of that stripping overburden removal activity in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 2, Inventories. To the extent the benefit is improved access to ore, the entity shall recognise these costs as a non-current asset, say, Stripping Activity Asset, if the criteria in paragraph 9 below are met.<br><br>9. An entity shall recognise a stripping activity asset if, and only if, all of the following are met:<br>(a) it is probable that the future economic benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the entity;<br><br>(b) the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved; and<br><br>(c) the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably.<br><br>10. The stripping activity asset shall be accounted for as an addition to, or as an enhancement of, an existing asset. In other words, the stripping activity asset will be accounted for as part of an existing asset.<br><br>11. The stripping activity asset’s classification as a tangible or intangible asset is the same as the existing asset. In other words, the nature of this existing asset will determine whether the entity shall classify the stripping activity asset as tangible or intangible.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Initial measurement of the stripping activity asset<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>12. The entity shall initially measure the stripping activity asset at cost, this being the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. Examples of the types of costs that would be included as directly attributable overhead costs include an allocation of salary costs of the mine supervisor overseeing that component of the mine, and the rental costs of any equipment that was hired specifically to perform the stripping activity. Some incidental operations may take place at the same time as the production stripping activity, but which are not necessary for the production stripping activity to continue as planned. The costs associated with these incidental operations shall not be included in the cost of the stripping activity asset. An example of such type of incidental operations would be building an access road in the area in which the stripping campaign is taking place.<br><br>13. When the costs of the stripping activity asset and the inventory produced are not separately identifiable, the entity shall allocate the production stripping costs between the inventory produced and the stripping activity asset by using an allocation basis that is based on a relevant production measure. This production measure shall be calculated for the identified component of the ore body, and shall be used as a benchmark to identify the extent to which the additional activity of creating a future benefit has taken place. Examples of such measures include:<br><br>(a) cost of inventory produced compared with expected cost;<br><br>(b) volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production; and<br><br>(c) mineral content of the ore extracted compared with expected mineral content to be extracted, for a given quantity of ore produced.<br><br>13A&nbsp; The production measure shall not be calculated using a basis that is based on sales values. A basis that is based on sales values, in the context of stripping costs, is inappropriate because it is not closely linked to the activity taking place. Furthermore, if the current sales price of the relevant material is used in determining the allocation basis, the same current sales price will be applied to the volume of the mineral in both the extracted ore and the identified component. Hence, the relevant variable will be the volume of mineral in both the extracted ore and the identified component, i.e., the current sales price will not change the allocation basis. Applying a future sales price basis involves practical difficulties. Identifying a future sales price for ore that will be mined in the future can be difficult, given the volatility of market prices for many minerals. Further complexities may arise when more than one mineral is present (whether by- products or joint products) when the ore is extracted.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Subsequent measurement of the stripping activity asset<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>14. After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset shall be carried at either its cost or its revalued amount less depreciation or amortisation and less impairment losses, in the same way as the existing asset of which it is a part.<br><br>15. The stripping activity asset shall be depreciated or amortised on a systematic basis, over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the stripping activity. The units of production method shall be applied unless another method is more appropriate.<br><br>16. The expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that is used to depreciate or amortise the stripping activity asset will differ from the expected useful life that is used to depreciate or amortise the mine itself and the related life- of-mine assets. The exception to this are those limited circumstances when the stripping activity provides improved access to the whole of the remaining ore body. For example, this might occur towards the end of a mine’s useful life when the identified component represents the final part of the ore body to be extracted.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Appendix C.</span></p><p class="cs587AD28F"><span class="cs5E98E930">References to matters contained in other Indian Accounting Standards<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br></span><span class="csD007A21A">This Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS.<br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><br>This appendix lists the appendices which are part of other Indian Accounting Standards and make reference to Ind AS 16, </span><span class="csD007A21A">Property, Plant and Equipment.</span></p><p class="csC4290383"><span class="cs1996077C"><a class="csEC80D8B8" href="#MCAj"><span class="cs48129E1B">j</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">[1.
