Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">Objective</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">1 The objective of this Standard is to establish the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Meeting the objective</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">2 To meet the objective in paragraph 1, the core principle of this Standard is that an entity shall recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">3 An entity shall consider the terms of the contract and all relevant facts and circumstances when applying this Standard. An entity shall apply this Standard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">4 This Standard specifies the accounting for an individual contract with a customer. However, as a practical expedient, an entity may apply this Standard to a portfolio of contracts (or performance obligations) with similar characteristics if the entity reasonably expects that the effects on the financial statements of applying this Standard to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying this Standard to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. When accounting for a portfolio, an entity shall use estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Scope</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">5 An entity shall apply this Standard to all contracts with customers, except the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csD9152503"><a class="cs8B52A05E" href="#MCAb"><span class="cs48129E1B">b</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">[(a) lease contracts within the scope of Ind AS 116, Leases;]</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) insurance contracts within the scope of Ind AS 104, Insurance Contracts;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations within the scope of Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments, Ind AS 110, Consolidated Financial Statements, Ind AS 111, Joint Arrangements, Ind AS 27, Separate Financial Statements and Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(d) non-monetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers or potential customers. For example, this Standard would not apply to a contract between two oil companies that agree to an exchange of oil to fulfil demand from their customers in different specified locations on a timely basis.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">6 An entity shall apply this Standard to a contract (other than a contract listed in paragraph 5) only if the counterparty to the contract is a customer. A customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity’s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. A counterparty to the contract would not be a customer if, for example, the counterparty has contracted with the entity to participate in an activity or process in which the parties to the contract share in the risks and benefits that result from the activity or process (such as developing an asset in a collaboration arrangement) rather than to obtain the output of the entity’s ordinary activities.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">7 A contract with a customer may be partially within the scope of this Standard and partially within the scope of other Standards listed in paragraph 5.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) If the other Standards specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of the contract, then an entity shall first apply the separation and/or measurement requirements in those Standards. An entity shall exclude from the transaction price the amount of the part (or parts) of the contract that are initially measured in accordance with other Standards and shall apply paragraphs 73–86 to allocate the amount of the transaction price that remains (if any) to each performance obligation within the scope of this Standard and to any other parts of the contract identified by paragraph 7(b).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) If the other Standards do not specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of the contract, then the entity shall apply this Standard to separate and/or initially measure the part (or parts) of the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">8 This Standard specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and for the costs incurred to fulfil a contract with a customer if those costs are not within the scope of another Standard (see paragraphs 91–104). An entity shall apply those paragraphs only to the costs incurred that relate to a contract with a customer (or part of that contract) that is within the scope of this Standard.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Recognition</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Identifying the contract</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">9 An entity shall account for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of this Standard only when all of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">(a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform the ir re s pective obligations;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">(b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">(c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">(d) the contract has commercial substance (ie the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">(e) it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. In e valuating whether collectability of an amount of consideration is probable, an entity shall consider only the customer’s ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. The amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled may be less than the price stated in the contract if the consideration is variable because the entity may offer the customer a price concession (see paragraph 52).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">10 A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. Enforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of law. Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an entity’s customary business practices. The practices and processes for establishing contracts with customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities. In addition, they may vary within an entity (for example, they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the promised goods or services). An entity shall consider those practices and processes in determining whether and when an agreement with a customer creates enforceable rights and obligations.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">11 Some contracts with customers may have no fixed duration and can be terminated or modified by either party at any time. Other contracts may automatically renew on a periodic basis that is specified in the contract.

A contract is wholly unperformed if both of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the entity has not yet transferred any promised goods or services to the customer; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the entity has not yet received, and is not yet entitled to receive, any consideration in exchange for promised goods or services. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">13 If a contract with a customer meets the criteria in paragraph 9 at contract inception, an entity shall not reassess those criteria unless there is an indication of a significant change in facts and circumstances. For example, if a customer’s ability to pay the consideration deteriorates significantly, an entity would reassess whether it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the remaining goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">14 If a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9, an entity shall continue to assess the contract to determine whether the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">15 When a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9 and an entity receives consideration from the customer, the entity shall recognise the consideration received as revenue only when either of the following events has occurred:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the entity has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and all, or substantially all, of the consideration promised by the customer has been received by the entity and is non-refundable; or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the contract has been terminated and the consideration received from the customer is nonrefundable.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">16 An entity shall recognise the consideration received from a customer as a liability until one of the events in paragraph 15 occurs or until the criteria in paragraph 9 are subsequently met (see paragraph 14). Depending on the facts and circumstances relating to the contract, the liability recognised represents the entity’s obligation to either transfer goods or services in the future or refund the consideration received. In either case, the liability shall be measured at the amount of consideration received from the customer.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Combination of contracts</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">17 An entity shall combine two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer (or related parties of the customer) and account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) the goods or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or services promised in each of the contracts) are a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraphs 22–30.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Contract modifications</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">18 A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. In some industries and jurisdictions, a contract modification may be described as a change order, a variation or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties to a contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. A contract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices. If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract modification, an entity shall continue to apply this Standard to the existing contract until the contract modification is approved.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">19 A contract modification may exist even though the parties to the contract have a dispute about the scope or price (or both) of the modification or the parties have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet determined the corresponding change in price. In determining whether the rights and obligations that are created or changed by a modification are enforceable, an entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances including the terms of the contract and other evidence. If the parties to a contract have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet determined the corresponding change in price, an entity shall estimate the change to the transaction price arising from the modification in accordance with paragraphs 50–54 on estimating variable consideration and paragraphs 56–58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">20 An entity shall account for a contract modification as a separate contract if both of the following conditions are present:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised goods or services that are distinct (in accordance with paragraphs 26–30); and 15</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity’s standalone selling prices of the additional promised goods or services and any appropriate adjustments to that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract. For example, an entity may adjust the stand-alone selling price of an additional good or service for a discount that the customer receives, because it is not necessary for the entity to incur the selling-related costs that it would incur when selling a similar good or service to a new customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">21 If a contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract in accordance with paragraph 20, an entity shall account for the promised goods or services not yet transferred at the date of the contract modification (ie the remaining promised goods or services) in whichever of the following ways is applicable:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, if the remaining goods or services are distinct from the goods or services transferred on or before the date of the contract modification. The amount of consideration to be allocated to the remaining performance obligations (or to the remaining distinct goods or services in a single performance obligation identified in accordance with paragraph 22(b)) is the sum of:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(i) the consideration promised by the customer (including amounts already received from the customer) that was included in the estimate of the transaction price and that had not been recognised as revenue; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(ii) the consideration promised as part of the contract modification.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a part of the existing contract if the remaining goods or services are not distinct and, therefore, form part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. The effect that the contract modification has on the transaction price, and on the entity’s measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, is recognised as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) at the date of the contract modification (ie the adjustment to revenue is made on a cumulative catch-up basis).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c)&nbsp;If the remaining goods or services are a combination of items (a) and (b), then the entity shall account for the effects of the modification on the unsatisfied (including partially unsatisfied) performance obligations in the modified contract in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of this paragraph.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Identifying performance obligations</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">22 At contract inception, an entity shall assess the goods or services promis ed in a contract with a customer and shall identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (see paragraph 23).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">23 A series of distinct goods or services has the same pattern of transfer to the customer if both of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) each distinct good or service in the series that the entity promises to transfer to the customer would meet the criteria in paragraph 35 to be a performance obligation satisfied over time; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) in accordance with paragraphs 39–40, the same method would be used to measure the entity’s progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each distinct good or service in the series to the customer</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Promises in contracts with customers</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">24 A contract with a customer generally explicitly states the goods or services that an entity promises to transfer to a customer. However, the performance obligations identified in a contract with a customer may not be limited to the goods or services that are explicitly stated in that contract. This is because a contract with a customer may also include promises that are implied by an entity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements if, at the time of entering into the contract, those promises create a valid expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">25 Performance obligations do not include activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service to a customer. For example, a services provider may need to perform various administrative tasks to set up a contract. The performance of those tasks does not transfer a service to the customer as the tasks are performed. Therefore, those setup activities are not a performance obligation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Distinct goods or services</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">26 Depending on the contract, promised goods or services may include, but are not limited to, the following</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) sale of goods produced by an entity (for example, inventory of a manufacturer);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) resale of goods purchased by an entity (for example, merchandise of a retailer);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) resale of rights to goods or services purchased by an entity (for example, a ticket resold by an entity acting as a principal, as described in paragraphs B34–B38);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(d) performing a contractually agreed-upon task (or tasks) for a customer;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(e) providing a service of standing ready to provide goods or services (for example, unspecified updates to software that are provided on a when-and-if-available basis) or of making goods or services available for a customer to use as and when the customer decides;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(f) providing a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to a customer (for example, acting as an agent of another party, as described in paragraphs B34–B38);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(g) granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future that a customer can resell or provide to its customer (for example, an entity selling a product to a retailer promises to transfer an additional good or service to an individual who purchases the product from the retailer);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(h) constructing, manufacturing or developing an asset on behalf of a customer;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(i) granting licences (see paragraphs B52–B63B); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(j) granting options to purchase additional goods or services (when those options provide a customer with a material right, as described in paragraphs B39–B43).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">27 A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if both of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (ie the good or service is capable of being distinct); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (ie the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">28 A customer can benefit from a good or service in accordance with paragraph27(a) if the good or service could be used, consumed, sold for an amount that is greater than scrap value or otherwise held in a way that generates economic benefits. For some goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from a good or service on its own. For other goods or services, a customer may be able to benefit from the good or service only in conjunction with other readily available resources. A readily available resource is a good or service that is sold separately (by the entity or another entity) or a resource that the customer has already obtained from the entity (including goods or services that the entity will have already transferred to the customer under the contract) or from other transactions or events. Various factors may provide evidence that the customer can benefit from a good or service either on its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources. For example, the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately would indicate that a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other readily available resources.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">29 In assessing whether an entity’s promises to transfer goods or services to the customer are separately identifiable in accordance with paragraph 27(b), the objective is to determine whether the nature of the promise, within the context of the contract, is to transfer each of those goods or services individually or, instead, to transfer a combined item or items to which the promised goods or services are inputs. Factors that indicate that two or more promises to transfer goods or services to a customer are not separately identifiable include, but are not limited to, the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or outputs for which the customer has contracted. In other words, the entity is using the goods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the combined output or outputs specified by the customer. A combined output or outputs might include more than one phase, element or unit.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) one or more of the goods or services significantly modifies or customises, or are significantly modified or customised by, one or more of the other goods or services promised in the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) the goods or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated. In other words, each of the goods or services is significantly affected by one or more of the other goods or services in the contract. For example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are significantly affected by each other because the entity would not be able to fulfil its promise by transferring each of the goods or services independently.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">30 If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity shall combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct. In some cases, that would result in the entity accounting for all the goods or services promised in a contract as a single performance obligation.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Satisfaction of performance obligations</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">31 An entity shall recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (ie an asset) to a customer.

If an entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">33 Goods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are received and used (as in the case of many services).

The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative use to the entity is made at contract inception. After contract inception, an entity shall not update the assessment of the alternative use of an asset unless the parties to the contract approve a contract modification that substantively changes the performance obligation. Paragraphs B6–B8 provide guidance for assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">37 An entity shall consider the terms of the contract, as well as any laws that apply to the contract, when evaluating whether it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date in accordance with paragraph 35(c). The right to payment for performance completed to date does not need to be for a fixed amount. However, at all times throughout the duration of the contract, the entity must be entitled to an amount that at least compensates the entity for performance completed to date if the contract is terminated by the customer or another party for reasons other than the entity’s failure to perform as promised. Paragraphs B9–B13 provide guidance for assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment and whether an entity’s right to payment would entitle the entity to be paid for its performance completed to date.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">38 If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35–37, an entity satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity shall consider the requirements for control in paragraphs 31–34. In addition, an entity shall consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) The entity has a present right to payment for the asset—if a customer is presently obliged to pay for an asset, then that may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset in exchange.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) The customer has legal title to the asset—legal title may indicate which party to a contract has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, an asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits. Therefore, the transfer of legal title of an asset may indicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset. If an entity retains legal title solely as protection against the customer’s failure to pay, those rights of the entity would not preclude the customer from obtaining control of an asset.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset—the customer’s physical possession of an asset may indicate that the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits. However, physical possession may not coincide with control of an asset. For example, in some repurchase agreements and in some consignment arrangements, a customer or consignee may have physical possession of an asset that the entity controls. Conversely, in some bill-and-hold arrangements, the entity may have physical possession of an asset that the customer controls. Paragraphs B64–B76, B77–B78 and B79–B82 provide guidance on accounting for repurchase agreements, consignment arrangements and bill-andhold arrangements, respectively.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(d) The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset—the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the customer may indicate that the customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. However, when evaluating the risks and rewards of ownership of a promised asset, an entity shall exclude any risks that give rise to a separate performance obligation in addition to the performance obligation to transfer the asset. For example, an entity may have transferred control of an asset to a customer but not yet satisfied an additional performance obligation to provide maintenance services related to the transferred asset.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(e) The customer has accepted the asset—the customer’s acceptance of an asset may indicate that it has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset. To evaluate the effect of a contractual customer acceptance clause on when control of an asset is transferred, an entity shall consider the guidance in paragraphs B83–B86.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">39 For each performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35–37, an entity shall recognise revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.

The promised consideration can also vary if an entity’s entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event. For example, an amount of consideration would be variable if either a product was sold with a right of return or a fixed amount is promised as a performance bonus on achievement of a specified milestone.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">51AA In some contracts, penalties are specified. In such cases, penalties shall be accounted for as per the substance of the contract. Where the penalty is inherent in determination of transaction price, it shall form part of variable consideration. For example, where an entity agrees to transfer control of a good or service in a contact with customer at the end of 30 days for Rs. 1,00,000 and if it exceeds 30 days, the entity is entitled to receive only Rs. 95,000, the reduction of Rs. 5,000 shall be regarded as variable consideration. In other cases, the transaction price shall be considered as fixed.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">52 The variability relating to the consideration promised by a customer may be explicitly stated in the contract. In addition to the terms of the contract, the promised consideration is variable if either of the following circumstances exists:&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the customer has a valid expectation arising from an entity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements that the entity will accept an amount of consideration that is less than the price stated in the contract. That is, it is expected that the entity will offer a price concession. Depending on the jurisdiction, industry or customer this offer may be referred to as a discount, rebate, refund or credit.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) other facts and circumstances indicate that the entity’s intention, when entering into the contract with the customer, is to offer a price concession to the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">53 An entity shall estimate an amount of variable consideration by using either of the following methods, depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) The expected value—the expected value is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. An expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if an entity has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) The most likely amount—the most likely amount is the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (ie the single most likely outcome of the contract). The most likely amount may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (for example, an entity either achieves a performance bonus or does not).&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">54 An entity shall apply one method consistently throughout the contract when estimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration to which the entity will be entitled. In addition, an entity shall consider all the information (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available to the entity and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. The information that an entity uses to estimate the amount of variable consideration would typically be similar to the information that the entity’s management uses during the bid-and-proposal process and in establishing prices for promised goods or services.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csD9152503">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csD9152503">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csD9ADF08C">Refund liabilities</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csD9152503">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">55 An entity shall recognise a refund liability if the entity receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received (or receivable) for which the entity does not expect to be entitled (ie amounts not included in the transaction price). The refund liability (and corresponding change in the transaction price and, therefore, the contract liability) shall be updated at the end of each reporting period for changes in circumstances. To account for a refund liability relating to a sale with a right of return, an entity shall apply the guidance in paragraphs B20–B27.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">Constraining estimates of variable consideration</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">56 An entity shall include in the transaction price some or all of an amount of variable consideration estimated in accordance with paragraph 53 only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">57 In assessing whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur once the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is subsequently resolved, an entity shall consider both the likelihood and the magnitude of the revenue reversal.

In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing component. A significant financing component may exist regardless of whether the promise of financing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms agreed to by the parties to the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">61 The objective when adjusting the promised amount of consideration for a significant financing component is for an entity to recognise revenue at an amount that reflects the price that a customer would have paid for the promised goods or services if the customer had paid cash for those goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the customer (ie the cash selling price). An entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether a contract contains a financing component and whether that financing component is significant to the contract, including both of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the difference, if any, between the amount of promised consideration and the cash selling price of the promised goods or services; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the combined effect of both of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(i) the expected length of time between when the entity transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(ii) the prevailing interest rates in the relevant market.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">62 Notwithstanding the assessment in paragraph 61, a contract with a customer would not have a significant financing component if any of the following factors exist:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the customer paid for the goods or services in advance and the timing of the transfer of those goods or services is at the discretion of the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer is variable and the amount or timing of that consideration varies on the basis of the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event that is not substantially within the control of the customer or the entity (for example, if the consideration is a sales-based royalty).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) the difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the good or service (as described in paragraph 61) arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or the entity, and the difference between those amounts is proportional to the reason for the difference.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">For example, the payment terms might provide the entity or the customer with protection from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">63 As a practical expedient, an entity need not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">64 To meet the objective in paragraph 61 when adjusting the promised amount of consideration for a significant financing component, an entity shall use the discount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the entity and its customer at contract inception. That rate would reflect the credit characteristics of the party receiving financing in the contract, as well as any collateral or security provided by the customer or the entity, including assets transferred in the contract. An entity may be able to determine that rate by identifying the rate that discounts the nominal amount of the promised consideration to the price that the customer would pay in cash for the goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the customer. After contract inception, an entity shall not update the discount rate for changes in interest rates or other circumstances (such as a change in the assessment of the customer’s credit risk).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">65 An entity shall present the effects of financing (interest revenue or interest expense) separately from revenue from contracts with customers in the statement of profit and loss. Interest revenue or interest expense is recognised only to the extent that a contract asset (or receivable) or a contract liability is recognised in accounting for a contract with a customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Non-cash consideration</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">66 To determine the transaction price for contracts in which a customer promises consideration in a form other than cash, an entity shall measure the non-cash consideration (or promise of non-cash consideration) at fair value.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">67 If an entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the non-cash consideration, the entity shall measure the consideration indirectly by reference to the stand-alone selling price of the goods or services promised to the customer (or class of customer) in exchange for the consideration.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">68 The fair value of the non-cash consideration may vary because of the form of the consideration (for example, a change in the price of a share to which an entity is entitled to receive from a customer). If the fair value of the non-cash consideration promised by a customer varies for reasons other than only the form of the consideration (for example, the fair value could vary because of the entity’s performance), an entity shall apply the requirements in paragraphs 56–58.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">69 If a customer contributes goods or services (for example, materials, equipment or labour) to facilitate an entity’s fulfilment of the contract, the entity shall assess whether it obtains control of those contributed goods or services. If so, the entity shall account for the contributed goods or services as non-cash consideration received from the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Consideration payable to a customer</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">70 Consideration payable to a customer includes cash amounts that an entity pays, or expects to pay, to the customer (or to other parties that purchase the entity’s goods or services from the customer). Consideration payable to a customer also includes credit or other items (for example, a coupon or voucher) that can be applied against amounts owed to the entity (or to other parties that purchase the entity’s goods or services from the customer). An entity shall account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service (as described in paragraphs 26–30) that the customer transfers to the entity. If the consideration payable to a customer includes a variable amount, an entity shall estimate the transaction price (including assessing whether the estimate of variable consideration is constrained) in accordance with paragraphs 50–58.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">71 If consideration payable to a customer is a payment for a distinct good or service from the customer, then an entity shall account for the purchase of the good or service in the same way that it accounts for other purchases from suppliers. If the amount of consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of the distinct good or service that the entity receives from the customer, then the entity shall account for such an excess as a reduction of the transaction price. If the entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received from the customer, it shall account for all of the consideration payable to the customer as a reduction of the transaction price.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">72 Accordingly, if consideration payable to a customer is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price, an entity shall recognise the reduction of revenue when (or as) the later of either of the following events occurs: (a) the entity recognises revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer; and (b) the entity pays or promises to pay the consideration (even if the payment is conditional on a future event). That promise might be implied by the entity’s customary business practices. Allocating the transaction price to performance obligations</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">73 The objective when allocating the transaction price is for an entity to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation (or distinct good or service) in an amount that de picts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">74 To meet the allocation objective, an entity shall allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis in accordance with&nbsp;paragraphs 76–80, except as specified in paragraphs 81–83 (for allocating discounts) and paragraphs 84–86 (for allocating consideration that includes variable amounts).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">75 Paragraphs 76–86 do not apply if a contract has only one performance obligation. However, paragraphs 84–86 may apply if an entity promises to transfer a series of distinct goods or services identified as a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraph 22(b) and the promised consideration includes variable amounts.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Allocation based on stand-alone selling prices</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">76 To allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, an entity shall determine the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of the distinct good or service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocate the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">77 The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. A contractually stated price or a list price for a good or service may be (but shall not be presumed to be) the stand-alone selling price of that good or service.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">78 If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate the stand-alone selling price at an amount that would result in the allocation of the transaction price meeting the allocation objective in paragraph 73. When estimating a stand-alone selling price, an entity shall consider all information (including market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available to the entity. In doing so, an entity shall maximise the use of observable inputs and apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">79 Suitable methods for estimating the stand-alone selling price of a good or service include, but are not limited to, the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) Adjusted market assessment approach—an entity could evaluate the market in which it sells goods or services and estimate the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay for those goods or services. That approach might also include referring to prices from the entity’s competitors for similar goods or services and adjusting those prices as necessary to reflect the entity’s costs and margins.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) Expected cost plus a margin approach—an entity could forecast its expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that good or service.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) Residual approach—an entity may estimate the stand-alone selling price by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable stand-alone selling prices of other goods or services promised in the contract. However, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate, in accordance with paragraph 78, the stand-alone selling price of a good or service only if one of the following criteria is met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(i) the entity sells the same good or service to different customers (at or near the same time) for a broad range of amounts (ie the selling price is highly variable because a representative stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence); or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(ii) the entity has not yet established a price for that good or service and the good or service has not previously been sold on a stand-alone basis (ie the selling price is uncertain).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">80 A combination of methods may need to be used to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services promised in the contract if two or more of those goods or services have highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices. For example, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate the aggregate stand-alone selling price for those promised goods or services with highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices and then use another method to estimate the stand-alone selling&nbsp;prices of the individual goods or services relative to that estimated aggregate stand-alone selling price determined by the residual approach. When an entity uses a combination of methods to estimate the stand-alone selling price of each promised good or service in the contract, the entity shall evaluate whether allocating the transaction price at those estimated stand-alone selling prices would be consistent with the allocation objective in paragraph 73 and the requirements for estimating stand-alone selling prices in paragraph 78.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Allocation of a discount</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">81 A customer receives a discount for purchasing a bundle of goods or services if the sum of the standalone selling prices of those promised goods or services in the contract exceeds the promised consideration in a contract. Except when an entity has observable evidence in accordance with paragraph 82 that the entire discount relates to only one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract, the entity shall allocate a discount proportionately to all performance obligations in the contract. The proportionate allocation of the discount in those circumstances is a consequence of the entity allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of the underlying distinct goods or services.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">82 An entity shall allocate a discount entirely to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in the contract if all of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the entity regularly sells each distinct good or service (or each bundle of distinct goods or services) in the contract on a stand-alone basis;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the entity also regularly sells on a stand-alone basis a bundle (or bundles) of some of those distinct goods or services at a discount to the stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services in each bundle; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) the discount attributable to each bundle of goods or services described in paragraph 82(b) is substantially the same as the discount in the contract and an analysis of the goods or services in each bundle provides observable evidence of the performance obligation (or performance obligations) to which the entire discount in the contract belongs.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">83 If a discount is allocated entirely to one or more performance obligations in the contract in accordance with paragraph 82, an entity shall allocate the discount before using the residual approach to estimate the stand-alone selling price of a good or service in accordance with paragraph 79(c).&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Allocation of variable consideration</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">84 Variable consideration that is promised in a contract may be attributable to the entire contract or to a specific part of the contract, such as either of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) one or more, but not all, performance obligations in the contract (for example, a bonus may be contingent on an entity transferring a promised good or service within a specified period of time); or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) one or more, but not all, distinct goods or services promised in a series of distinct goods or services that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraph 22(b) (for example, the consideration promised for the second year of a two-year cleaning service contract will increase on the basis of movements in a specified inflation index).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">85 An entity shall allocate a variable amount (and subsequent changes to that amount) entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraph 22(b) if both of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the terms of a variable payment relate specifically to the entity’s efforts to satisfy the performance obligation or transfer the distinct good or service (or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation or transferring the distinct good or service); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">&nbsp;(b) allocating the variable amount of consideration entirely to the performance obligation or the distinct good or service is consistent with the allocation objective in paragraph 73 when considering all of the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">86 The allocation requirements in paragraphs 73–83 shall be applied to allocate the remaining amount of the transaction price that does not meet the criteria in paragraph 85.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Changes in the transaction price&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">87 After contract inception, the transaction price can change for various reasons, including the resolution of uncertain events or other changes in circumstances that change the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the promised goods or services.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">88 An entity shall allocate to the performance obligations in the contract any subsequent changes in the transaction price on the same basis as at contract inception.

Examples include routine or recurring services (such as a cleaning service) in which the receipt and simultaneous consumption by the customer of the benefits of the entity’s performance can be readily identified.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B4 For other types of performance obligations, an entity may not be able to readily identify whether a customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the entity’s performance as the entity performs. In those circumstances, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if an entity determines that another entity would not need to substantially re-perform the work that the entity has completed to date if that other entity were to fulfil the remaining performance obligation to the customer. In determining whether another entity would not need to substantially re-perform the work the entity has completed to date, an entity shall make both of the following assumptions:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) disregard potential contractual restrictions or practical limitations that otherwise would prevent the entity from transferring the remaining performance obligation to another entity; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) presume that another entity fulfilling the remainder of the performance obligation would not have the benefit of any asset that is presently controlled by the entity and that would remain controlled by the entity if the performance obligation were to transfer to another entity.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Customer controls the asset as it is created or enhanced (paragraph 35(b))&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B5 In determining whether a customer controls an asset as it is created or enhanced in accordance with paragraph 35(b), an entity shall apply the requirements for control in paragraphs 31–34 and 38. The asset that is being created or enhanced (for example, a work-in-progress asset) could be either tangible or intangible.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use (paragraph 35(c))</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B6 In assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity in accordance with paragraph 36, an entity shall consider the effects of contractual restrictions and practical limitations on the entity’s ability to readily direct that asset for another use, such as selling it to a different customer. The possibility of the contract with the customer being terminated is not a relevant consideration in assessing whether the entity would be able to readily direct the asset for another use.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B7 A contractual restriction on an entity’s ability to direct an asset for another use must be substantive for the asset not to have an alternative use to the entity. A contractual restriction is substantive if a customer could enforce its rights to the promised asset if the entity sought to direct the asset for another use. In contrast, a contractual restriction is not substantive if, for example, an asset is largely interchangeable with other assets that the entity could transfer to another customer without breaching the contract and without incurring significant costs that otherwise would not have been incurred in relation to that contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B8 A practical limitation on an entity’s ability to direct an asset for another use exists if an entity would incur significant economic losses to direct the asset for another use. A significant economic loss could arise because the entity either would incur significant costs to rework the asset or would only be able to sell the asset at a significant loss. For example, an entity may be practically limited from redirecting assets that either have design specifications that are unique to a customer or are located in remote areas.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">Right to payment for performance completed to date (paragraph 35(c))</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B9 In accordance with paragraph 37, an entity has a right to payment for performance completed to date if the entity would be entitled to an amount that at least compensates the entity for its performance completed to date in the event that the customer or another party terminates the contract for reasons other than the entity’s failure to perform as promised. An amount that would compensate an entity for performance completed to date would be an amount that approximates the selling price of the goods or services transferred to date (for example, recovery of the costs incurred by an entity in satisfying the performance obligation plus a reasonable profit margin) rather than compensation for only the entity’s potential loss of profit if the contract were to be terminated. Compensation for a reasonable profit margin need not equal the profit margin expected if the contract was fulfilled as promised, but an entity should be entitled to compensation for either of the following amounts:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) a proportion of the expected profit margin in the contract that reasonably reflects the extent of the entity’s performance under the contract before termination by the customer (or another party); or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a reasonable return on the entity’s cost of capital for similar contracts (or the entity’s typical operating margin for similar contracts) if the contract-specific margin is higher than the return the entity usually generates from similar contracts.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B10 An entity’s right to payment for performance completed to date need not be a present unconditional right to payment. In many cases, an entity will have an unconditional right to payment only at an agreed-upon milestone or upon complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. In assessing whether it has a right to payment for performance completed to date, an entity shall consider whether it would have an enforceable right to demand or retain payment for performance completed to date if the&nbsp;contract were to be terminated before completion for reasons other than the entity’s failure to perform as promised.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B11 In some contracts, a customer may have a right to terminate the contract only at specified times during the life of the contract or the customer might not have any right to terminate the contract. If a customer acts to terminate a contract without having the right to terminate the contract at that time (including when a customer fails to perform its obligations as promised), the contract (or other laws) might entitle the entity to continue to transfer to the customer the goods or services promised in the contract and require the customer to pay the consideration promised in exchange for those goods or services. In those circumstances, an entity has a right to payment for performance completed to date because the entity has a right to continue to perform its obligations in accordance with the contract and to require the customer to perform its obligations (which include paying the promised consideration).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B12 In assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment for performance completed to date, an entity shall consider the contractual terms as well as any legislation or legal precedent that could supplement or override those contractual terms. This would include an assessment of whether:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) legislation, administrative practice or legal precedent confers upon the entity a right to payment for performance to date even though that right is not specified in the contract with the customer;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) relevant legal precedent indicates that similar rights to payment for performance completed to date in similar contracts have no binding legal effect; or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) an entity’s customary business practices of choosing not to enforce a right to payment has resulted in the right being rendered unenforceable in that legal environment. However, notwithstanding that an entity may choose to waive its right to payment in similar contracts, an entity would continue to have a right to payment to date if, in the contract with the customer, its right to payment for performance to date remains enforceable.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B13 The payment schedule specified in a contract does not necessarily indicate whether an entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Although the payment schedule in a contract specifies the timing and amount of consideration that is payable by a customer, the payment schedule might not necessarily provide evidence of the entity’s right to payment for performance completed to date. This is because, for example, the contract could specify that the consideration received from the customer is refundable for reasons other than the entity failing to perform as promised in the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Methods for measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B14 Methods that can be used to measure an entity’s progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 35–37 include the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) output methods (see paragraphs B15–B17); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) input methods (see paragraphs B18–B19).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Output methods</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B15 Output methods recognise revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract. Output methods include methods such as surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed and units produced or units delivered. When an entity evaluates whether to apply an output method to measure its progress, the entity shall consider whether the output selected would faithfully depict the entity’s performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. An output method would not provide a faithful depiction of the entity’s performance if the output selected would fail to measure some of the goods or services for which control has transferred to the customer. For example, output methods based on units produced or units delivered would not faithfully depict an entity’s performance in satisfying a performance&nbsp;obligation if, at the end of the reporting period, the entity’s performance has produced work in progress or finished goods controlled by the customer that are not included in the measurement of the output.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B16 As a practical expedient, if an entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date (for example, a service contract in which an entity bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the entity may recognise revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B17 The disadvantages of output methods are that the outputs used to measure progress may not be directly observable and the information required to apply them may not be available to an entity without undue cost. Therefore, an input method may be necessary.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Input methods</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B18 Input methods recognise revenue on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (for example, resources consumed, labour hours expended, costs incurred, time elapsed or machine hours used) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. If the entity’s efforts or inputs are expended evenly throughout the performance period, it may be appropriate for the entity to recognise revenue on a straight-line basis.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B19 A shortcoming of input methods is that there may not be a direct relationship between an entity’s inputs and the transfer of control of goods or services to a customer. Therefore, an entity shall exclude from an input method the effects of any inputs that, in accordance with the objective of measuring progress in paragraph 39, do not depict the entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services to the customer. For instance, when using a cost-based input method, an adjustment to the measure of progress may be required in the following circumstances:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) When a cost incurred does not contribute to an entity’s progress in satisfying the performance obligation. For example, an entity would not recognise revenue on the basis of costs incurred that are attributable to significant inefficiencies in the entity’s performance that were not reflected in the price of the contract (for example, the costs of unexpected amounts of wasted materials, labour or other resources that were incurred to satisfy the performance obligation).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) When a cost incurred is not proportionate to the entity’s progress in satisfying the performance obligation. In those circumstances, the best depiction of the entity’s performance may be to adjust the input method to recognise revenue only to the extent of that cost incurred. For example, a faithful depiction of an entity’s performance might be to recognise revenue at an amount equal to the cost of a good used to satisfy a performance obligation if the entity expects at contract inception that all of the following conditions would be met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(i) the good is not distinct;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(ii) the customer is expected to obtain control of the good significantly before receiving services related to the good;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(iii) the cost of the transferred good is significant relative to the total expected costs to completely satisfy the performance obligation; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(iv) the entity procures the good from a third party and is not significantly involved in designing and manufacturing the good (but the entity is acting as a principal in accordance with paragraphs B34–B38).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Sale with a right of return</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B20 In some contracts, an entity transfers control of a product to a customer and also grants the customer the right to return the product for various reasons (such as dissatisfaction with the product) and receive any combination of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) a full or partial refund of any consideration paid;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a credit that can be applied against amounts owed, or that will be owed, to the entity; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) another product in exchange.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B20AA In some contracts, an entity transfers control of a product to a customer with an unconditional right of return. In such cases, the recognition of revenue shall be as per the substance of the arrangement. Where the substance is that of a consignment sale, the entity shall account for such a contract as per the provisions of paragraph B77 of this Appendix. In other cases, the accounting for contracts with customers shall be as per paragraphs B21-B27.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B21 To account for the transfer of products with a right of return (and for some services that are provided subject to a refund), an entity shall recognise all of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) revenue for the transferred products in the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled (therefore, revenue would not be recognised for the products expected to be returned);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a refund liability; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) an asset (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) for its right to recover products from customers on settling the refund liability.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B22 An entity’s promise to stand ready to accept a returned product during the return period shall not be accounted for as a performance obligation in addition to the obligation to provide a refund.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B23 An entity shall apply the requirements in paragraphs 47–72 (including the requirements for constraining estimates of variable consideration in paragraphs 56–58) to determine the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled (ie excluding the products expected to be returned). For any amounts received (or receivable) for which an entity does not expect to be entitled, the entity shall not recognise revenue when it transfers products to customers but shall recognise those amounts received (or receivable) as a refund liability. Subsequently, at the end of each reporting period, the entity shall update its assessment of amounts for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the transferred products and make a corresponding change to the transaction price and, therefore, in the amount of revenue recognised.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B24 An entity shall update the measurement of the refund liability at the end of each reporting period for changes in expectations about the amount of refunds. An entity shall recognise corresponding adjustments as revenue (or reductions of revenue).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B25 An asset recognised for an entity’s right to recover products from a customer on settling a refund liability shall initially be measured by reference to the former carrying amount of the product (for example, inventory) less any expected costs to recover those products (including potential decreases in the value to the entity of returned products). At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update the measurement of the asset arising from changes in expectations about products to be returned. An entity shall present the asset separately from the refund liability.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B26 Exchanges by customers of one product for another of the same type, quality, condition and price (for example, one colour or size for another) are not considered returns for the purposes of applying this Standard.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B27 Contracts in which a customer may return a defective product in exchange for a functioning product shall be evaluated in accordance with the guidance on warranties in paragraphs B28–B33.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Warranties</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B28 It is common for an entity to provide (in accordance with the contract, the law or the entity’s customary business practices) a warranty in connection with the sale of a product (whether a good or service). The nature of a warranty can vary significantly across industries and contracts. Some warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it&nbsp;complies with agreed-upon specifications. Other warranties provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B29 If a customer has the option to purchase a warranty separately (for example, because the warranty is priced or negotiated separately), the warranty is a distinct service because the entity promises to provide the service to the customer in addition to the product that has the functionality described in the contract. In those circumstances, an entity shall account for the promised warranty as a performance obligation in accordance with paragraphs 22–30 and allocate a portion of the transaction price to that performance obligation in accordance with paragraphs 73–86.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B30 If a customer does not have the option to purchase a warranty separately, an entity shall account for the warranty in accordance with Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, unless the promised warranty, or a part of the promised warranty, provides the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B31 In assessing whether a warranty provides a customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications, an entity shall consider factors such as:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) Whether the warranty is required by law—if the entity is required by law to provide a warranty, the existence of that law indicates that the promised warranty is not a performance obligation because such requirements typically exist to protect customers from the risk of purchasing defective products.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) The length of the warranty coverage period—the longer the coverage period, the more likely it is that the promised warranty is a performance obligation because it is more likely to provide a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) The nature of the tasks that the entity promises to perform—if it is necessary for an entity to perform specified tasks to provide the assurance that a product complies with agreed-upon specifications (for example, a return shipping service for a defective product), then those tasks likely do not give rise to a performance obligation.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B32 If a warranty, or a part of a warranty, provides a customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications, the promised service is a performance obligation. Therefore, an entity shall allocate the transaction price to the product and the service. If an entity promises both an assurance-type warranty and a service-type warranty but cannot reasonably account for them separately, the entity shall account for both of the warranties together as a single performance obligation.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B33 A law that requires an entity to pay compensation if its products cause harm or damage does not give rise to a performance obligation. For example, a manufacturer might sell products in a jurisdiction in which the law holds the manufacturer liable for any damages (for example, to personal property) that might be caused by a consumer using a product for its intended purpose. Similarly, an entity’s promise to indemnify the customer for liabilities and damages arising from claims of patent, copyright, trademark or other infringement by the entity’s products does not give rise to a performance obligation. The entity shall account for such obligations in accordance with Ind AS 37.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Principal versus agent considerations</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B34 When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, the entity shall determine whether the nature of its promise is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods or services itself (ie the entity is a principal) or to arrange for those goods or services to be provided by the other party (ie the entity is an agent). An entity determines whether it is a principal or an agent for each specified good or service promised to the customer. A specified good or service is a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services) to be provided to the customer (see paragraphs 27–30). If a contract with a customer includes more than one specified good or service, an entity could be a principal for some specified goods or services and an agent for others.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B34A To determine the nature of its promise (as described in paragraph B34), the entity shall:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) identify the specified goods or services to be provided to the customer (which, for example, could be a right to a good or service to be provided by another party (see paragraph 26)); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) assess whether it controls (as described in paragraph 33) each specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B35 An entity is a principal if it controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer. However, an entity does not necessarily control a specified good if the entity obtains legal title to that good only momentarily before legal title is transferred to a customer. An entity that is a principal may satisfy its performance obligation to provide the specified good or service itself or it may engage another party (for example, a subcontractor) to satisfy some or all of the performance obligation on its behalf.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B35A When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity that is a principal obtains control of any one of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) a good or another asset from the other party that it then transfers to the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) a good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer. For example, if an entity provides a significant service of integrating goods or services (see paragraph 29(a)) provided by another party into the specified good or service for which the customer has contracted, the entity controls the specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer. This is because the entity first obtains control of the inputs to the specified good or service (which includes goods or services from other parties) and directs their use to create the combined output that is the specified good or service.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B35B When (or as) an entity that is a principal satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B36 An entity is an agent if the entity’s performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of the specified good or service by another party. An entity that is an agent does not control the specified good or service provided by another party before that good or service is transferred to the customer. When (or as) an entity that is an agent satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognises revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. An entity’s fee or commission might be the net amount of consideration that the entity retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for the goods or services to be provided by that party.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B37 Indicators that an entity controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer (and is therefore a principal (see paragraph B35)) include, but are not limited to, the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service. This typically includes responsibility for the acceptability of the specified good or service (for example, primary responsibility for the good or service meeting customer specifications). If the entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service, this may indicate that the other party involved in providing the specified good or service is acting on the entity’s behalf.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the entity has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer or after transfer of control to the customer (for example, if the customer has a right of return). For example, if the entity obtains, or commits itself to obtain, the specified good or service before obtaining a contract with a customer, that may indicate that the entity has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service before it is transferred to the customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) the entity has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. Establishing the price that the customer pays for the specified good or service may indicate that the entity has the ability to direct the use of that good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits. However, an agent can have discretion in establishing prices in some cases. For example, an agent may have some flexibility in setting prices in order to generate additional revenue from its service of arranging for goods or services to be provided by other parties to customers.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B37A The indicators in paragraph B37 may be more or less relevant to the assessment of control depending on the nature of the specified good or service and the terms and conditions of the contract. In addition, different indicators may provide more persuasive evidence in different contracts.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B38 If another entity assumes the entity’s performance obligations and contractual rights in the contract so that the entity is no longer obliged to satisfy the performance obligation to transfer the specified good or service to the customer (ie the entity is no longer acting as the principal), the entity shall not recognise revenue for that performance obligation. Instead, the entity shall evaluate whether to recognise revenue for satisfying a performance obligation to obtain a contract for the other party (ie whether the entity is acting as an agent).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Customer options for additional goods or services</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B39 Customer options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount come in many forms, including sales incentives, customer award credits (or points), contract renewal options or other discounts on future goods or services.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B40 If, in a contract, an entity grants a customer the option to acquire additional goods or services, that option gives rise to a performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into that contract (for example, a discount that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given for those goods or services to that class of customer in that geographical area or market). If the option provides a material right to the customer, the customer in effect pays the entity in advance for future goods or services and the entity recognises revenue when those future goods or services are transferred or when the option expires.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B41 If a customer has the option to acquire an additional good or service at a price that would reflect the stand-alone selling price for that good or service, that option does not provide the customer with a material right even if the option can be exercised only by entering into a previous contract. In those cases, the entity has made a marketing offer that it shall account for in accordance with this Standard only when the customer exercises the option to purchase the additional goods or services.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B42 Paragraph 74 requires an entity to allocate the transaction price to performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. If the stand-alone selling price for a customer’s option to acquire additional goods or services is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate it. That estimate shall reflect the discount that the customer would obtain when exercising the option, adjusted for both of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) any discount that the customer could receive without exercising the option; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the likelihood that the option will be exercised.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">&nbsp;B43 If a customer has a material right to acquire future goods or services and those goods or services are similar to the original goods or services in the contract and are provided in accordance with the terms of the original contract, then an entity may, as a practical alternative to estimating the stand-alone selling price of the option, allocate the transaction price to the optional goods or services by reference to the goods or services expected to be provided and the corresponding expected consideration. Typically, those types of options are for contract renewals. Customers’ unexercised rights</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B44 In accordance with paragraph 106, upon receipt of a prepayment from a customer, an entity shall recognise a contract liability in the amount of the prepayment for its performance obligation to transfer, or to stand ready to transfer, goods or services in the future. An entity shall derecognise that contract liability (and recognise revenue) when it transfers those goods or services and, therefore, satisfies its performance obligation.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B45 A customer’s non-refundable prepayment to an entity gives the customer a right to receive a good or service in the future (and obliges the entity to stand ready to transfer a good or service). However, customers may not exercise all of their contractual rights. Those unexercised rights are often referred to as breakage.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B46 If an entity expects to be entitled to a breakage amount in a contract liability, the entity shall recognise the expected breakage amount as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer. If an entity does not expect to be entitled to a breakage amount, the entity shall recognise the expected breakage amount as revenue when the likelihood of the customer exercising its remaining rights becomes remote. To determine whether an entity expects to be entitled to a breakage amount, the entity shall consider the requirements in paragraphs 56–58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B47 An entity shall recognise a liability (and not revenue) for any consideration received that is attributable to a customer’s unexercised rights for which the entity is required to remit to another party, for example, a government entity in accordance with applicable unclaimed property laws.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Non-refundable upfront fees (and some related costs)</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B48 In some contracts, an entity charges a customer a non-refundable upfront fee at or near contract inception. Examples include joining fees in health club membership contracts, activation fees in telecommunication contracts, setup fees in some services contracts and initial fees in some supply contracts.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B49 To identify performance obligations in such contracts, an entity shall assess whether the fee relates to the transfer of a promised good or service. In many cases, even though a non-refundable upfront fee relates to an activity that the entity is required to undertake at or near contract inception to fulfil the contract, that activity does not result in the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer (see paragraph 25). Instead, the upfront fee is an advance payment for future goods or services and, therefore, would be recognised as revenue when those future goods or services are provided. The revenue recognition period would extend beyond the initial contractual period if the entity grants the customer the option to renew the contract and that option provides the customer with a material right as described in paragraph B40.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B50 If the non-refundable upfront fee relates to a good or service, the entity shall evaluate whether to account for the good or service as a separate performance obligation in accordance with paragraphs 22– 30.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B51 An entity may charge a non-refundable fee in part as compensation for costs incurred in setting up a contract (or other administrative tasks as described in paragraph 25). If those setup activities do not satisfy a performance obligation, the entity shall disregard those activities (and related costs) when measuring progress in accordance with paragraph B19. That is because the costs of setup activities do not depict the transfer of services to the customer. The entity shall assess whether costs incurred in setting up a contract have resulted in an asset that shall be recognised in accordance with paragraph 95.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Licensing</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B52 A licence establishes a customer’s rights to the intellectual property of an entity. Licences of intellectual property may include, but are not limited to, licences of any of the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) software and technology;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) motion pictures, music and other forms of media and entertainment;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) franchises; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(d) patents, trademarks and copyrights.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B53 In addition to a promise to grant a licence (or licences) to a customer, an entity may also promise to transfer other goods or services to the customer. Those promises may be explicitly stated in the contract or implied by an entity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements (see paragraph 24). As with other types of contracts, when a contract with a customer includes a promise to grant a licence (or licences) in addition to other promised goods or services, an entity applies paragraphs 22–30 to identify each of the performance obligations in the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B54 If the promise to grant a licence is not distinct from other promised goods or services in the contract in accordance with paragraphs 26–30, an entity shall account for the promise to grant a licence and those other promised goods or services together as a single performance obligation. Examples of licences that are not distinct from other goods or services promised in the contract include the following:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) a licence that forms a component of a tangible good and that is integral to the functionality of the good; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a licence that the customer can benefit from only in conjunction with a related service (such as an online service provided by the entity that enables, by granting a licence, the customer to access content).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B55 If the licence is not distinct, an entity shall apply paragraphs 31–38 to determine whether the performance obligation (which includes the promised licence) is a performance obligation that is satisfied over time or satisfied at a point in time.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B56 If the promise to grant the licence is distinct from the other promised goods or services in the contract and, therefore, the promise to grant the licence is a separate performance obligation, an entity shall determine whether the licence transfers to a customer either at a point in time or over time. In making this determination, an entity shall consider whether the nature of the entity’s promise in granting the licence to a customer is to provide the customer with either:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) a right to access the entity’s intellectual property as it exists throughout the licence period; or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) a right to use the entity’s intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the licence is granted.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Determining the nature of the entity’s promise</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B57 *</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B58 The nature of an entity’s promise in granting a licence is a promise to provide a right to access the entity’s intellectual property if all of the following criteria are met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the contract requires, or the customer reasonably expects, that the entity will undertake activities that significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights (see paragraph B59 and B59A);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the rights granted by the licence directly expose the customer to any positive or negative effects of the entity’s activities identified in paragraph B58(a); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) those activities do not result in the transfer of a good or a service to the customer as those activities occur (see paragraph 25).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B59 Factors that may indicate that a customer could reasonably expect that an entity will undertake activities that significantly affect the intellectual property include the entity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements. Although not determinative, the existence of a shared economic interest (for example, a sales-based royalty) between the entity and the customer related to the intellectual property to which the customer has rights may also indicate that the customer could reasonably expect that the entity will undertake such activities.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B59A An entity’s activities significantly affect the intellectual property to which the customer has rights when either:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) those activities are expected to significantly change the form (for example, the design or content) or the functionality (for example, the ability to perform a function or task) of the intellectual property; or</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from the intellectual property is substantially derived from, or dependent upon, those activities. For example, the benefit from a brand is often derived from, or dependent upon, the entity’s ongoing activities that support or maintain the value of the intellectual property.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">Accordingly, if the intellectual property to which the customer has rights has significant stand-alone functionality, a substantial portion of the benefit of that intellectual property is derived from that functionality. Consequently, the ability of the customer to obtain benefit from that intellectual property would not be significantly affected by the entity’s activities unless those activities significantly change its form or functionality. Types of intellectual property that often have significant stand-alone functionality include software, biological compounds or drug formulas, and completed media content (for example, films, television shows and music recordings).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B60 If the criteria in paragraph B58 are met, an entity shall account for the promise to grant a licence as a performance obligation satisfied over time because the customer will simultaneously receive and consume the benefit from the entity’s performance of providing access to its intellectual property as the performance occurs (see paragraph 35(a)). An entity shall apply paragraphs 39–45 to select an appropriate method to measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation to provide access.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B61 If the criteria in paragraph B58 are not met, the nature of an entity’s promise is to provide a right to use the entity’s intellectual property as that intellectual property exists (in terms of form and functionality) at the point in time at which the licence is granted to the customer. This means that the customer can direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the licence at the point in time at which the licence transfers. An entity shall account for the promise to provide a right to use the entity’s intellectual property as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time. An entity shall apply paragraph 38 to determine the point in time at which the licence transfers to the customer. However, revenue cannot be recognised for a licence that provides a right to use the entity’s intellectual property before the beginning of the period during which the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence. For example, if a software licence period begins before an entity provides (or otherwise&nbsp;makes available) to the customer a code that enables the customer to immediately use the software, the entity would not recognise revenue before that code has been provided (or otherwise made available).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B62 An entity shall disregard the following factors when determining whether a licence provides a right to access the entity’s intellectual property or a right to use the entity’s intellectual property:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) Restrictions of time, geographical region or use—those restrictions define the attributes of the promised licence, rather than define whether the entity satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time or over time.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) Guarantees provided by the entity that it has a valid patent to intellectual property and that it will defend that patent from unauthorised use—a promise to defend a patent right is not a performance obligation because the act of defending a patent protects the value of the entity’s intellectual property assets and provides assurance to the customer that the licence transferred meets the specifications of the licence promised in the contract.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Sales-based or usage-based royalties</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B63 Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs 56–59, an entity shall recognise revenue for a salesbased or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a licence of intellectual property only when (or as) the later of the following events occurs:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the subsequent sale or usage occurs; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B63A The requirement for a sales-based or usage-based royalty in paragraph B63 applies when the royalty relates only to a licence of intellectual property or when a licence of intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates (for example, the licence of intellectual property may be the predominant item to which the royalty relates when the entity has a reasonable expectation that the customer would ascribe significantly more value to the licence than to the other goods or services to which the royalty relates).</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B63B When the requirement in paragraph B63A is met, revenue from a sales-based or usage-based royalty shall be recognised wholly in accordance with paragraph B63. When the requirement in paragraph B63A is not met, the requirements on variable consideration in paragraphs 50–59 apply to the sales-based or usagebased royalty.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Repurchase agreements</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B64 A repurchase agreement is a contract in which an entity sells an asset and also promises or has the option (either in the same contract or in another contract) to repurchase the asset. The repurchased asset may be the asset that was originally sold to the customer, an asset that is substantially the same as that asset, or another asset of which the asset that was originally sold is a component.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B65 Repurchase agreements generally come in three forms:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) an entity’s obligation to repurchase the asset (a forward);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) an entity’s right to repurchase the asset (a call option); and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) an entity’s obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer’s request (a put option).

For example, a customer may request an entity to enter into such a contract because of the customer’s lack of available space for the product or because of delays in the customer’s production schedules.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B80 An entity shall determine when it has satisfied its performance obligation to transfer a product by evaluating when a customer obtains control of that product (see paragraph 38). For some contracts, control is transferred either when the product is delivered to the customer’s site or when the product is shipped, depending on the terms of the contract (including delivery and shipping terms). However, for some contracts, a customer may obtain control of a product even though that product remains in an entity’s physical possession. In that case, the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the product even though it has decided not to exercise its right to take physical possession of that product. Consequently, the entity does not control the product. Instead, the entity provides custodial services to the customer over the customer’s asset.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B81 In addition to applying the requirements in paragraph 38, for a customer to have obtained control of a product in a bill-and-hold arrangement, all of the following criteria must be met:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement must be substantive (for example, the customer has requested the arrangement);</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the product must be identified separately as belonging to the customer;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) the product currently must be ready for physical transfer to the customer; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(d) the entity cannot have the ability to use the product or to direct it to another customer.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B82 If an entity recognises revenue for the sale of a product on a bill-and-hold basis, the entity shall consider whether it has remaining performance obligations (for example, for custodial services) in accordance with paragraphs 22–30 to which the entity shall allocate a portion of the transaction price in accordance with paragraphs 73–86.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Customer acceptance</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B83 In accordance with paragraph 38(e), a customer’s acceptance of an asset may indicate that the customer has obtained control of the asset. Customer acceptance clauses allow a customer to cancel a contract or require an entity to take remedial action if a good or service does not meet agreed-upon specifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">An entity shall consider such clauses when evaluating when a customer obtains control of a good or service.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B84 If an entity can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality that would not affect the entity’s determination of when the customer has obtained control of the good or service. For example, if the customer acceptance clause is based on meeting specified size and weight characteristics, an entity would be able to determine whether those criteria have been met before receiving confirmation of the customer’s acceptance. The entity’s experience with contracts for similar goods or services may provide evidence that a good or service provided to the customer is in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract. If revenue is recognised before customer acceptance, the entity still must consider whether there are any remaining performance obligations (for example, installation of equipment) and evaluate whether to account for them separately.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B85 However, if an entity cannot objectively determine that the good or service provided to the customer is in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then the entity would not be able to conclude that the customer has obtained control until the entity receives the customer’s acceptance. That is because in that circumstance the entity cannot determine that the customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">B86 If an entity delivers products to a customer for trial or evaluation purposes and the customer is not committed to pay any consideration until the trial period lapses, control of the product is not transferred to the customer until either the customer accepts the product or the trial period lapses.

Some entities may need to use more than one type of category to meet the objective in paragraph 114 for disaggregating revenue.

The infrastructure may already exist, or may be constructed during the period of the service arrangement. An arrangement within the scope of this Appendix typically involves a private sector entity (an operator) constructing the infrastructure used to provide the public service or upgrading it (for example, by increasing its capacity) and operating and maintaining that infrastructure for a specified period of time. The operator is paid for its services over the period of the arrangement. The arrangement is governed by a contract that sets out performance standards, mechanisms for adjusting prices, and arrangements for arbitrating disputes. Such an arrangement is often described as a ‘build-operatetransfer’, a ‘rehabilitate-operate-transfer’ or a ‘public-to-private’ service concession arrangement.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">3 A feature of these service arrangements is the public service nature of the obligation undertaken by the operator. Public policy is for the services related to the infrastructure to be provided to the public, irrespective of the identity of the party that operates the services. The service arrangement contractually obliges the operator to provide the services to the public on behalf of the public sector entity. Other common features are:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the party that grants the service arrangement (the grantor) is a public sector entity, including a governmental body, or a private sector entity to which the responsibility for the service has been devolved.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the operator is responsible for at least some of the management of the infrastructure and related services and does not merely act as an agent on behalf of the grantor.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(c) the contract sets the initial prices to be levied by the operator and regulates price revisions over the period of the service arrangement.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(d) the operator is obliged to hand over the infrastructure to the grantor in a specified condition at the end of the period of the arrangement, for little or no incremental consideration, irrespective of which party initially financed it.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Scope</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">4 This Appendix gives guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service concession arrangements.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">5 This Appendix applies to public-to-private service concession arrangements if:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) the grantor controls—through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise—any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">6 Infrastructure used in a public-to-private service concession arrangement for its entire useful life (whole of life assets) is within the scope of this Appendix if the conditions in paragraph 5(a) of this Appendix are met.

These contractual obligations to maintain or restore infrastructure, except for any upgrade element (see paragraph 14 of this Appendix), shall be recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 37, ie at the best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Borrowing costs incurred by the operator</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">22 In accordance with Ind AS 23, borrowing costs attributable to the arrangement shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless the operator has a contractual right to receive an intangible asset (a right to charge users of the public service).

In applying this condition, the grantor and any related parties shall be considered together. If the grantor is a public sector entity, the public sector as a whole, together with any regulators acting in the public interest, shall be regarded as related to the grantor for the purposes of this Appendix D.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">AG3 For the purpose of condition (a), the grantor does not need to have complete control of the price: it is sufficient for the price to be regulated by the grantor, contract or regulator, for example by a capping mechanism. However, the condition shall be applied to the substance of the agreement. Non-substantive features, such as a cap that will apply only in remote circumstances, shall be ignored. Conversely, if for example, a contract purports to give the operator freedom to set prices, but any excess profit is returned to the grantor, the operator’s return is capped and the price element of the control test is met.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">AG4 For the purpose of condition (b), the grantor’s control over any significant residual interest should both restrict the operator’s practical ability to sell or pledge the infrastructure and give the grantor a continuing right of use throughout the period of the arrangement. The residual interest in the infrastructure is the estimated current value of the infrastructure as if it were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of the period of the arrangement.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">AG5 Control should be distinguished from management. If the grantor retains both the degree of control described in paragraph 5(a) of Appendix D and any significant residual interest in the infrastructure, the operator is only managing the infrastructure on the grantor’s behalf—even though, in many cases, it may have wide managerial discretion.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">AG6 Conditions (a) and (b) together identify when the infrastructure, including any replacements required (see paragraph 21 of Appendix D), is controlled by the grantor for the whole of its economic life. For example, if the operator has to replace part of an item of infrastructure during the period of the arrangement (eg the top layer of a road or the roof of a building), the item of infrastructure shall be considered as a whole. Thus condition (b) is met for the whole of the infrastructure, including the part that is replaced, if the grantor controls any significant residual interest in the final replacement of that part.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">AG7 Sometimes the use of infrastructure is partly regulated in the manner described in paragraph 5(a) of Appendix D and partly unregulated. However, these arrangements take a variety of forms:</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(a) any infrastructure that is physically separable and capable of being operated independently and meets the definition of a cash-generating unit as defined in Ind AS 36 shall be analysed separately if it is used wholly for unregulated purposes. For example, this might apply to a private wing of a hospital, where the remainder of the hospital is used by the grantor to treat public patients.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">(b) when purely ancillary activities (such as a hospital shop) are unregulated, the control tests shall be applied as if those services did not exist, because in cases in which the grantor controls the services in the manner described in paragraph 5 of Appendix D, the existence of ancillary activities does not detract from the grantor’s control of the infrastructure.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csD9152503">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csD9152503"><a class="cs8B52A05E" href="#MCAg"><span class="cs48129E1B">g</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">[AG8 The operator may have a right to use the separable infrastructure described in paragraph AG7(a), or the facilities used to provide ancillary unregulated services described in paragraph AG7(b). In either case, there may in substance be a lease from the grantor to the operator; if so, it shall be accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 116.;]</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Information note 1</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Accounting framework for public-to-private service arrangements</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">This note accompanies, but is not part of, Appendix D The diagram below summarises the accounting for service arrangements established by Appendix A</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">(Flow Chart)</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">Information note 2</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csBC65EB4A">References to Indian Accounting Standards that apply to typical types of public-to-private arrangements</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">This note accompanies, but is not part of, Appendix D.</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="cs25A8605A">&nbsp;The table sets out the typical types of arrangements for private sector participation in the provision of public sector services and provides references to Indian Accounting Standards that apply to those arrangements.
