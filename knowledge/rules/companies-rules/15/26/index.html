<strong><br>
<i>Earnings per Share</i></strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>(This Indian Accounting Standard includes paragraphs set in bold type and plain type, which have equal authority.  Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)</i><br>
<br>
<b><u>Objective</u></b><br>
<br>
1	The objective of this Standard is to prescribe principles for the determination and presentation of earnings per share, so as to improve performance comparisons between different entities in the same reporting period and between different reporting periods for the same entity. Even though earnings per share data have limitations because of the different accounting policies that may be used for determining ‘earnings’, a consistently determined denominator enhances financial reporting. The focus of this Standard is  on the denominator of the earnings per share calculation.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Scope</b></u><br>
<br>
2	This Indian Accounting Standard shall apply to companies that have issued ordinary shares<sup>1 </sup>to which Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) notified under the Companies Act apply.<br>
<b>[Refer Appendix 1]</b><br>
<br>
<b>3	An entity that discloses earnings per share shall calculate and disclose earnings per share in accordance with this Standard.<br>
<br>
4	When an entity presents both consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements prepared in accordance with Ind AS  110, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Ind AS 27, Separate Financial Statements, respectively, the disclosures required by this Standard shall be presented both in the consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements. In consolidated financial statements such disclosures shall be based on consolidated information and in separate financial statements such disclosures shall be based on information given in separate financial statements. An entity shall not present in consolidated financial statements, earnings per share based on the information given in separate financial statements and shall not present in separate financial statements, earnings per share based on the information given in consolidated financial statements.<br>
<br>
4A&nbsp;	[Refer Appendix 1]</b><br>
<br>
<b>Definitions<br>
<br>
5	The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified: Antidilution is an increase in earnings per share or a reduction in loss per share resulting from the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.<br>
<br>
A contingent share agreement is an agreement to issue shares that is dependent on the satisfaction of specified conditions.<br>
<br>
Contingently issuable ordinary shares are ordinary shares issuable for little or no cash or other consideration upon the satisfaction of specified conditions in a contingent share agreement.<br>
<br>
Dilution is a reduction in earnings per share or an increase in loss per share resulting from the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.<br>
<br>
Options, warrants and their equivalents are financial instruments that give the holder the right to purchase ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
An ordinary share is an equity instrument that is subordinate to all other classes of equity instruments.<br>
<br>
A potential ordinary share is a financial instrument or other contract  that may entitle its holder to ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
Put options on ordinary shares are contracts that give the holder the right to sell ordinary shares at a specified price for a given period.</b><br>
<br>
6	Ordinary shares participate in profit for the period only after other types of shares such as preference shares have participated. An entity may have more than one class of ordinary shares. Ordinary shares of the same class have the same rights to receive dividends.<br>
<br>
7	Examples of potential ordinary shares are:<br>
<br>
(a)	financial liabilities or equity instruments, including preference shares, that are convertible into ordinary shares;</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial">(b)	options and warrants;</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="2" face="Arial"><font size="2" face="Arial">(c)	shares that would be issued upon the  satisfaction of conditions resulting from contractual arrangements, such  as the purchase of a business or  other assets</font></font></font></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial">8	Terms defined in Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, are used in this Standard with the meanings specified in paragraph 11 of Ind AS 32, unless otherwise noted.  Ind  AS  32  defines  financial  instrument,  financial  asset,  financial  liability and equity instrument, and provides guidance on applying those definitions. Ind AS 113, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value and sets out requirements for applying that definition.<br>
<br>
<b>Measurement<br>
<br>
Basic earnings per share<br>
<br>
9	An entity shall calculate basic earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and, if presented, profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to those equity holders.<br>
<br>
10	Basic earnings per share shall be calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity (the numerator) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.</b><br>
<br>
11 The objective of basic earnings per share information is  to  provide a  measure  of the interests of each ordinary share of a parent entity in the performance of the entity over the reporting period.<br>
<br>
<b>Earnings<br>
<br>
12 For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share, the amounts attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity in respect of:<br>
<br>
(a)	profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the parent entity; and<br>
(b)	profit or loss attributable to the parent entity<br>
<br>
shall be the amounts in (a) and (b) adjusted for the after-tax amounts of preference dividends, differences arising on the settlement of preference shares, and other similar effects of preference shares classified as equity.<br>
<br>
Where any item of income or expense which is otherwise required to be recognised in profit or loss in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards is debited or credited to securities premium account/other reserves, the amount in respect thereof shall be deducted from profit or loss from continuing operations for the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share.</b><br>
<br>
13	All items of income and expense attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity that are recognised in a period, including tax expense and dividends on preference shares classified as liabilities are included in the determination of profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity (see Ind AS 1).<br>
<br>
14	The after-tax amount of preference dividends that is deducted from profit or loss is:<br>
<br>
(a)	the after-tax amount of any preference dividends on non-cumulative preference shares declared in respect of the period; and<br>
(b)	the after-tax amount of the preference dividends for cumulative preference shares required for the period, whether or not the dividends have been declared. The amount of preference dividends for the period does not include the amount of any preference dividends for cumulative preference shares paid or declared during the current period in respect of previous periods.<br>
<br>
15	Preference shares that provide for a low initial dividend to compensate an entity for selling the preference shares at a discount, or an above-market dividend in later periods to compensate investors for purchasing preference shares at a premium, are sometimes referred to as increasing rate preference shares. Any original issue discount or premium on increasing rate preference shares is amortised to retained earnings using the effective interest method and treated as a preference dividend for the purposes of calculating earnings per share (irrespective of whether such discount or premium is debited or credited to securities  premium account in view of requirements of any law).<br>
<br>
16	Preference shares may be repurchased under an entity’s tender offer to the holders. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid to the preference shareholders over the carrying amount of the preference shares represents a return to the holders of the preference shares and a charge to retained earnings for the entity. This amount is deducted in calculating profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity.<br>
<br>
17	Early conversion of convertible preference shares may be induced by an entity through favourable changes to the original conversion terms or the payment of additional consideration. The excess of the fair value of the ordinary shares or other consideration paid over the fair value of the ordinary shares issuable under the original conversion terms is a return to the preference shareholders, and is deducted in calculating profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity.<br>
<br>
18	Any excess of the carrying amount of preference shares over the fair value of the consideration paid to settle them is added in calculating profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity.<br>
<br>
Shares<br>
<br>
<b>19 For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares shall be the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.<br>
</b><br>
20	Using the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period reflects the possibility that the amount of shareholders’ capital varied during the period as a result of a larger or smaller number of shares being outstanding at any time. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the period, adjusted by the number of ordinary shares bought back or issued during the period multiplied by a time-weighting<br>
<br>
factor. The time-weighting factor is the number of days that the shares are outstanding as a proportion of the total number of days in the period; a reasonable approximation of the weighted average is adequate in many circumstances.<br>
<br>
21	Shares are usually included in the weighted average number of shares from the date consideration is receivable (which is generally the date of their issue), for example:<br>
<br>
(a)	ordinary shares issued in exchange for cash are included when cash is receivable;<br>
<br>
(b)	ordinary shares issued on the voluntary reinvestment of dividends on ordinary or preference shares are included when dividends are reinvested;<br>
<br>
(c)	ordinary shares issued as a result of the conversion of a debt instrument to ordinary shares are included from the date that interest ceases to accrue;<br>
<br>
(d)	ordinary shares issued in place of interest or principal on other financial instruments are included from the date that interest ceases to accrue;<br>
<br>
(e)	ordinary shares issued in exchange for the settlement of a liability of the entity are included from the settlement date;<br>
<br>
(f)	ordinary shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of an asset other than cash are included as of the date on which the acquisition is recognised; and<br>
<br>
(g)	ordinary shares issued for the rendering of services to the entity are included as the services are rendered.<br>
<br>
The timing of the inclusion of ordinary shares is determined by the terms and conditions attaching to their issue. Due consideration is given to the substance of any contract associated with the issue.<br>
<br>
22	Ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination are included in the weighted average number of shares from the acquisition date. This is because the acquirer incorporates into its statement of profit and loss the acquiree’s profits and losses from that date.<br>
<br>
23	Ordinary shares that will be issued upon the conversion of a mandatorily convertible instrument are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share from the date the contract is entered into.<br>
<br>
24	Contingently issuable shares are treated as outstanding and are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share only from the date when all necessary conditions are satisfied (ie the events have occurred). Shares that are issuable solely after the passage of time are not contingently issuable shares, because the passage of time is a certainty. Outstanding ordinary shares that are contingently returnable (ie subject to recall) are not treated as outstanding and are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share until the date the shares are no longer subject to recall.<br>
<br>
25	[Refer Appendix 1]<br>
<br>
<b>26&nbsp; The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented shall be adjusted for events, other than the conversion of potential ordinary shares, that have changed the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding change in resources.<br>
</b><br>
27	Ordinary shares may be issued, or the number of ordinary shares outstanding may be reduced, without a corresponding change in resources. Examples include:<br>
<br>
(a)	a capitalisation or bonus issue (sometimes referred to as a stock dividend);<br>
<br>
(b)	a bonus element in any other issue, for example a bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders;<br>
<br>
(c)	a share split; and<br>
<br>
(d)	a reverse share split (consolidation of shares).<br>
<br>
28	In a capitalisation or bonus issue or a share split, ordinary shares are issued to existing shareholders for no additional consideration. Therefore, the number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased without an increase in resources. The number of ordinary shares outstanding before the event is adjusted for the proportionate change in the number of ordinary shares outstanding as if the event had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. For example, on a two-for-one bonus issue, the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the issue is multiplied by three to obtain the new total number of ordinary shares, or by two to obtain the number of additional ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
29	A consolidation of ordinary shares generally reduces the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding reduction in resources. However, when the overall effect is a share repurchase at fair value, the reduction in the number of ordinary shares outstanding is the result of a corresponding reduction in resources. An example is a share consolidation combined with a special dividend. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period in which the combined transaction takes place is adjusted for the reduction in the number of ordinary shares from the date the special dividend is recognised.<br>
<br>
<b>Diluted earnings per share<br>
<br>
30	An entity shall calculate diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and, if presented, profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to those equity holders.<br>
<br>
31	For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, an entity shall adjust profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity, and the weighted average number of shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.</b><br>
<br>
32 The objective of diluted earnings per share is consistent with that of basic earnings per share—to provide a measure of the interest of each ordinary share in the performance of an entity—while giving effect to all dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the period. As a result:<br>
<br>
(a)	profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity is increased by the after-tax amount of dividends and interest recognised in the period in respect of the dilutive potential ordinary shares and is adjusted for any other changes in income or expense that would result from the conversion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares; and<br>
(b)	the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased by the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
<b>Earnings<br>
<br>
33 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, an entity shall adjust profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity, as calculated in accordance with paragraph 12, by the after-tax effect of:<br>
<br>
(a)	any dividends or other items related to dilutive potential ordinary shares deducted in arriving at profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity as calculated in accordance with paragraph 12;<br>
<br>
(b)	any interest recognised in the period related to dilutive potential ordinary shares; and<br>
<br>
(c)	any other changes in income or expense that would result from the conversion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.</b><br>
<br>
34	After the potential ordinary shares are converted into ordinary shares, the items identified in paragraph 33(a)–(c) no longer arise. Instead, the new ordinary shares are entitled to participate in profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity. Therefore, profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity calculated in accordance with paragraph 12 is adjusted for the items identified in paragraph 33(a)–(c) and any related taxes. The expenses associated with potential ordinary shares include transaction costs and discounts accounted for in accordance with the effective interest method (see Ind AS 109).<br>
<br>
35	The conversion of potential ordinary shares may lead to consequential changes in income or expenses. For example, the reduction of interest expense related to potential ordinary shares and the resulting increase in profit or reduction in loss may lead to an increase in the expense related to a non-discretionary employee profit-sharing plan. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings  per share, profit  or loss  attributable to  ordinary     equity holders of the parent entity is adjusted for any such consequential changes in income or expense.<br>
<br>
<b>Shares<br>
<br>
36 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares shall be the weighted average number of ordinary shares calculated in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 26, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Dilutive potential ordinary shares shall be deemed to have been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the period or, if later, the date of the issue of the potential ordinary shares.<br>
</b><br>
37	Dilutive potential ordinary shares shall be determined independently for each period presented. The number of dilutive potential ordinary shares included in the year-to-date period is not a weighted average of the dilutive potential ordinary shares included in each interim computation.<br>
<br>
38	Potential ordinary shares are weighted for the period they are outstanding. Potential ordinary shares that are cancelled or allowed to lapse during the period are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share only for the portion of the period during which they are outstanding. Potential ordinary shares that are converted into ordinary shares during the period are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share from the beginning of the period to the date of conversion; from the date of conversion, the resulting ordinary shares are included in both basic and diluted earnings per share.<br>
<br>
39	The number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares is determined from the terms of the potential ordinary shares. When more than one basis of conversion exists, the calculation assumes the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the holder of the potential ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
40	A subsidiary, joint venture or associate may issue to parties other than the parent or investors with joint control of, or significant influence over, the investee potential ordinary shares that are convertible into either ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate, or ordinary shares of the parent or investors with joint control of, or significant influence (the reporting entity) over, the investee. If these potential ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate have a dilutive effect on the basic earnings per share of the reporting entity, they are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.<br>
<br>
<b>Dilutive potential ordinary shares<br>
<br>
41 Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.</b><br>
<br>
42	An entity uses profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the parent entity as the control number to establish whether potential ordinary shares are dilutive or antidilutive. Profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the parent entity is adjusted in accordance with paragraph 12 and excludes items relating to discontinued operations.<br>
<br>
43	Potential ordinary shares are antidilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would increase earnings per share or decrease loss per share from continuing operations. The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.<br>
<br>
44	In determining whether potential ordinary shares are dilutive or antidilutive, each issue or series of potential ordinary shares is considered separately rather than in aggregate. The sequence in which potential ordinary shares are considered may affect whether they are dilutive. Therefore, to maximise the dilution of basic earnings per share, each issue or series of potential ordinary shares is considered in sequence from the most dilutive to the least dilutive, ie dilutive potential ordinary shares with the lowest ‘earnings per incremental share’ are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation before those with a higher earnings per incremental share. Options and warrants are generally included first because they do not affect the numerator of the calculation.<br>
<br>
<i>Options, warrants and their equivalents<br>
</i><br>
<b>45 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, an entity shall assume the exercise of dilutive options and warrants of the entity. The assumed proceeds from these instruments shall be regarded as having been received from the issue of ordinary shares at the average market price of ordinary shares during the period. The difference between the number of ordinary shares issued and the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued at the average market price  of ordinary shares during the period shall be treated as an issue of ordinary shares for no consideration.<br>
</b><br>
46	Options and warrants are dilutive when they would result in the issue of ordinary shares for less than the average market price of ordinary shares during the period. The amount of the dilution is the average market price of ordinary shares during the period minus the issue price. Therefore, to calculate diluted earnings per share, potential ordinary shares are treated as consisting of both the following:<br>
<br>
(a)	a contract to issue a certain number of the ordinary shares at their average market price during the period. Such ordinary shares are assumed to be fairly priced and to be neither dilutive nor antidilutive. They are ignored in the  calculation of diluted earnings per share.<br>
(b)	a contract to issue the remaining ordinary shares for no consideration. Such ordinary shares generate no proceeds and have no effect on profit or loss attributable to ordinary shares outstanding. Therefore, such shares are dilutive and are added to the number of ordinary shares outstanding in the  calculation of diluted earnings per share.<br>
<br>
47	Options and warrants have a dilutive effect only when the average market price of ordinary shares during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants (ie they are ‘in the money’). Previously reported earnings per share are not retroactively adjusted to reflect changes in prices of ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
47A&nbsp; For share options and other share-based payment arrangements to which Ind AS 102, Share-based Payment, applies, the issue price referred to in paragraph 46 and the exercise price referred to in paragraph 47 shall include the fair value (measured in accordance with Ind AS 102) of any goods or services to be supplied to the entity in the future under the share option or other share-based payment arrangement.<br>
<br>
48	Employee share options with fixed or determinable terms and non-vested ordinary shares are treated as options in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, even though they may be contingent on vesting. They are treated as outstanding on the grant date. Performance-based employee share options are treated as contingently issuable shares because their issue is contingent upon satisfying specified conditions in addition to the passage of time.<br>
<br>
<i>Convertible instruments</i><br>
<br>
49	The dilutive effect of convertible instruments shall be reflected in diluted earnings per share in accordance with paragraphs 33 and 36.<br>
<br>
50	Convertible preference shares are antidilutive whenever the amount of the dividend on such shares declared in or accumulated for the current period per ordinary share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic earnings per share. Similarly, convertible debt is antidilutive whenever its interest (net of tax and other changes in income or expense) per ordinary share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic earnings per share.<br>
<br>
51	The redemption or induced conversion of convertible preference shares may affect only a portion of the previously outstanding convertible preference shares. In such cases, any excess consideration referred to in paragraph 17 is attributed to those shares that are redeemed or converted for the purpose of determining whether the remaining outstanding preference shares are dilutive. The shares redeemed or converted are considered separately from those shares that are not redeemed or converted.<br>
<br>
<i>Contingently issuable shares</i><br>
<br>
52	As in the calculation of basic earnings per share, contingently issuable ordinary shares are treated as outstanding and included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the conditions are satisfied (ie the events have occurred). Contingently issuable shares are included from the beginning of the period (or from the date of the contingent share agreement, if later). If the conditions are not satisfied, the number of  contingently issuable shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the number of shares that would be issuable if the end of the period were the end of the contingency period. Restatement is not permitted if the conditions are not met when the contingency period expires.<br>
<br>
53	If attainment or maintenance of a specified amount of earnings for a period is the condition for contingent issue and if that amount has been attained at the end of the reporting period but must be maintained beyond the end of the reporting period for an additional period, then the additional ordinary shares are treated as outstanding, if the effect is dilutive, when calculating diluted earnings per share. In that case, the calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the number of ordinary shares that would be issued if the amount of earnings at the end of the reporting period were the amount of earnings at the end of the contingency period. Because earnings may change in a future period, the calculation of basic earnings per share does not include such contingently issuable ordinary shares until the end of the contingency period because not all necessary conditions have been satisfied.<br>
<br>
54	The number of ordinary shares contingently issuable may depend on the future market price of the ordinary shares. In that case, if the effect is dilutive, the calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the number of ordinary shares that would be issued if the market price at the end of the reporting period were the market price at the end of the contingency period. If the condition is based on an average of market prices over a period of time that extends beyond the end of the reporting period, the average for the period of time that has lapsed is used. Because the market price may change in a future period, the calculation of basic earnings per share does not include such contingently issuable ordinary shares until the end of the contingency period because not all necessary conditions have been satisfied.<br>
<br>
55	The number of ordinary shares contingently issuable may depend on future earnings and future prices of the ordinary shares. In such cases, the number of ordinary shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation is based on both conditions (ie earnings to date and the current market price at the end of the reporting period).  Contingently issuable ordinary shares are not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation unless both conditions are met.<br>
<br>
56	In other cases, the number of ordinary shares contingently issuable depends on a condition other than earnings or market price (for example, the opening of a specific number of retail stores). In such cases, assuming that the present status of the condition remains unchanged until the end of the contingency period, the contingently issuable ordinary shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share according to the status at the end of the reporting period.<br>
<br>
57	Contingently issuable potential ordinary shares (other than those covered by a contingent share agreement, such as contingently issuable convertible instruments) are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as follows:<br>
<br>
(a)	an entity determines whether the potential ordinary shares may be assumed to be issuable on the basis of the conditions specified for their issue in accordance with the contingent ordinary share provisions in paragraphs 52–56; and<br>
<br>
(b)	if those potential ordinary shares should be reflected in diluted earnings per share, an entity determines their impact on the calculation of diluted earnings per share by following the provisions for options and warrants in paragraphs 45–48, the provisions for convertible instruments in paragraphs 49–51, the provisions for contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash in paragraphs 58–61, or other provisions, as appropriate.<br>
<br>
However, exercise or conversion is not assumed for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share unless exercise or conversion of similar outstanding potential ordinary shares that are not contingently issuable is assumed.<br>
<br>
<i>Contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash</i><br>
<br>
<b>58      When an entity has issued a contract that may be settled in ordinary shares or  cash at the entity’s option, the entity shall presume that the contract will be settled in ordinary shares, and the resulting potential ordinary shares shall be included in diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.</b><br>
<br>
59   When such a contract is presented for accounting purposes as an asset or a liability, or has an equity component and a liability component, the entity shall adjust the numerator for any changes in profit or loss that would have resulted during the period if the contract had been classified wholly as an equity instrument. That adjustment is similar to the adjustments required in paragraph 33.<br>
<br>
<b>60  For contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash at the holder’s option, the more dilutive of cash settlement and share settlement shall be used in calculating diluted earnings per share.</b><br>
<br>
61	An example of a contract that may be settled in ordinary shares or cash is a debt instrument that, on maturity, gives the entity the unrestricted right to settle the principal amount in cash or in its own ordinary shares. Another example is a written put option that gives the holder a choice of settling in ordinary shares or cash.<br>
<br>
Purchased options<br>
<br>
62	Contracts such as purchased put options and purchased call options (ie options held by the entity on its own ordinary shares) are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because including them would be antidilutive. The put option would be exercised only if the exercise price were higher than the market price and the call option would be exercised only if the exercise price were lower than the market price.<br>
<br>
<i>Written put options<br>
</i><br>
<b>63	Contracts that require the entity to repurchase its own shares, such as written put options and forward purchase contracts, are reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive. If these contracts are ‘in the money’ during the period (ie the exercise or settlement price is above the average market price for that period), the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share shall be calculated as follows:<br>
<br>
(a)	it shall be assumed that at the beginning of the period sufficient ordinary shares will be issued (at the average market price during the period) to raise proceeds to satisfy the contract;<br>
<br>
(b)	it shall be assumed that the proceeds from the issue are used to satisfy the contract (ie to buy back ordinary shares); and<br>
<br>
(c)	the incremental ordinary shares (the difference between the number of ordinary shares assumed issued and the number of ordinary shares received from satisfying the contract) shall be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.<br>
<br>
<u>Retrospective adjustments</u><br>
<br>
64	If the number of ordinary or potential ordinary shares outstanding increases as a result of a capitalisation, bonus issue or share split, or decreases as a result of a reverse share split, the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented shall be adjusted retrospectively. If these changes occur after the reporting period but before the financial statements are approved for issue, the per share calculations for those and any prior period financial statements presented shall be based on the new number of shares. The fact that per share calculations reflect such changes in the number of shares shall be disclosed. In addition, basic and diluted earnings per share of all periods presented shall be adjusted for the effects of errors and adjustments resulting from changes in accounting policies accounted for retrospectively.</b><br>
<br>
65 An entity does not restate diluted earnings per share of any prior period presented for changes in the assumptions used in earnings per share calculations or for the conversion of potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
<b>Presentation</b><br>
<br>
<b>66   An entity shall present in the statement of profit and loss basic and diluted  earnings per share for profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and for profit or loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity for the period for each class of ordinary shares that has a different right to share in profit for the period. An entity shall present basic and diluted earnings per share with equal prominence for all periods presented.<br>
</b><br>
67 Earnings per share is presented for every period for which a statement of profit and loss is presented. If diluted earnings per share is reported for at least one period, it shall be reported for all periods presented, even if it equals basic earnings per share. If basic and diluted earnings per share are equal, dual presentation can be accomplished in one line in the statement of profit and loss.<br>
<br>
67A	[Refer Appendix 1]<br>
<br>
<b>68	An entity that reports a discontinued operation shall disclose the basic and diluted amounts per share for the discontinued operation either in the statement of profit and loss or in the notes.<br>
<br>
68A&nbsp;	[Refer Appendix 1]<br>
<br>
69	An entity shall present basic and diluted earnings per share, even if the amounts are negative (ie a loss per share).</b><br>
<br>
<b><u>Disclosure</u><br>
<br>
70	An entity shall disclose the following:<br>
<br>
(a)	the amounts used as the numerators in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share, and a reconciliation of those amounts to profit or loss attributable to the parent entity for the period. The reconciliation shall include the individual effect of each class of instruments that affects earnings per share.<br>
<br>
(b)	the weighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share, and a reconciliation of these denominators to each other. The reconciliation shall include the individual effect of each class of instruments that affects earnings per share.<br>
<br>
(c)	instruments (including contingently issuable shares) that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are antidilutive for the period(s) presented.<br>
<br>
(d)	a description of ordinary share transactions or potential ordinary share transactions, other than those accounted for in accordance with paragraph 64, that occur after the reporting period and that would have changed significantly the number of ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the period if those transactions had occurred before the end of the reporting period.</b><br>
<br>
71	Examples of transactions in paragraph 70(d) include:<br>
<br>
(a)	an issue of shares for cash;<br>
<br>
(b)	an issue of shares when the proceeds are used to repay debt or preference shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period;<br>
<br>
(c)	the redemption of ordinary shares outstanding;<br>
<br>
(d)	the conversion or exercise of potential ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period into ordinary shares;<br>
<br>
(e)	an issue of options, warrants, or convertible instruments; and<br>
<br>
(f)	the achievement of conditions that would result in the issue of contingently issuable shares. Earnings per share amounts are not adjusted for such transactions occurring after the reporting period because such transactions do not affect the amount of capital used to produce profit or loss for the period.<br>
<br>
72	Financial instruments and other contracts generating potential ordinary shares may incorporate terms and conditions that affect the measurement of basic and diluted earnings per share. These terms and conditions may determine whether any potential ordinary shares are dilutive and, if so, the effect on the weighted average number of shares outstanding and any consequent adjustments to profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders. The disclosure of the terms and conditions of such financial instruments and other contracts is encouraged, if not otherwise required (see Ind AS 107, Financial Instruments: Disclosures).<br>
<br>
<b>73  If an entity discloses, in addition to basic and diluted earnings per share, amounts per share using a reported component of the statement of profit and loss other than one required by this Standard, such amounts shall be calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares determined in accordance with this Standard. Basic and diluted amounts per share relating to such a component shall be disclosed with equal prominence and presented in the notes. An entity shall indicate the basis on which the numerator(s) is (are) determined, including whether  amounts per share are before tax or after tax. If a component of the statement of profit and loss is used that is not reported as a line item in the statement of profit and loss, a reconciliation shall be provided between the component used and a line item that is reported in the statement of profit and loss.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Application guidance</b><br>
This appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS.<br>
<br>
<b>Profit or loss attributable to the parent entity</b></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial">A1 For the purpose of calculating earnings per share based on the consolidated financial statements, profit or loss attributable to the parent entity refers to profit or loss of the consolidated entity after adjusting for non-controlling interests.<br>
<br>
<b>Rights issues</b></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial">A2 The issue of ordinary shares at the time of exercise or conversion of potential ordinary shares does not usually give rise to a bonus element. This is because the potential ordinary shares are usually issued for fair value, resulting in a proportionate change in the resources available to the entity. In a rights issue, however, the exercise price is often less than the fair value of the shares. Therefore, as noted in paragraph 27(b), such a rights issue includes a bonus element. If a rights issue is offered to all existing shareholders, the number of ordinary shares to be used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods before the rights issue is the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the issue, multiplied by the following factor:<br>
<br>
Fair value per share immediately before the exercise of rights<b>/</b>Theoretical ex-rights fair value per share<br>
<br>
The theoretical ex-rights fair value per share is calculated by adding the aggregate fair value of the shares immediately before the exercise of the rights to the proceeds from the exercise of the rights, and dividing by the number of shares outstanding after the exercise of the rights. Where the rights are to be publicly traded separately from the shares before the exercise date, fair value is measured at the close of the last day on which the shares are traded together with the rights.<br>
<br>
<b>Control number<br>
</b>A3   To illustrate the application of the control number notion described in paragraphs 42   and 43, assume that an entity has prfit from continuing operations attributable to the parent entity of Rs. 4,800, a loss from discontinued operations attributable to the parent entity of (Rs. 7,200), a loss attributable to the parent entity of (Rs. 2,400), and 2,000 ordinary shares and 400 potential ordinary shares outstanding. The entity’s basic earnings per share is Rs. 2.40 for continuing operations, (Rs. 3.60) for discontinued operations and (Rs. 1.20) for the loss. The 400 potential ordinary shares are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the resulting Rs. 2.00 earnings per share for continuing operations is dilutive, assuming no profit or loss impact of those 400 potential ordinary shares. Because profit from continuing operations attributable to  the parent entity is the control number, the entity also includes those 400 potential ordinary shares in the calculation of the other earnings per share amounts, even though the resulting earnings per share amounts are antidilutive to their comparable basic earnings per share amounts, ie the loss per share is less [(Rs. 3.00) per share for the loss from discontinued operations and (Rs.1.00) per share for the loss].<br>
<br>
<b>Average market price of ordinary shares<br>
</b>A4 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the average market price  of ordinary shares assumed to be issued is calculated on the basis of the average market price of the ordinary shares during the period. Theoretically, every market transaction for an entity’s ordinary shares could be included in the determination of the average market price. As a practical matter, however, a simple average of weekly or monthly prices is usually adequate.<br>
<br>
A5 Generally, closing market prices are adequate for calculating the average market price. When prices fluctuate widely, however, an average of the high and low prices usually produces a more representative price. The method used to calculate the average market price is used consistently unless it is no longer representative because of changed conditions. For example, an entity that uses closing market prices to calculate the average market price for several years of relatively stable prices might change to an average of high and low prices if prices start fluctuating greatly and the closing market prices no longer produce a representative average price.<br>
<br>
<b>Options, warrants and their equivalents<br>
</b>A6 Options or warrants to purchase convertible instruments are assumed to be exercised to purchase the convertible instrument whenever the average prices of both the convertible instrument and the ordinary shares obtainable upon conversion are above the exercise price of the options or warrants. However, exercise is not assumed unless conversion of similar outstanding convertible instruments, if any, is also assumed.<br>
<br>
A7   Options or warrants may permit or require the tendering of debt or other instruments of the entity (or its parent or a subsidiary) in payment of all or a portion of the exercise price. In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, those options or warrants have a dilutive effect if (a) the average market price of the related ordinary shares for the period exceeds the exercise price or (b) the selling price of the instrument to be tendered is below that at which the instrument may be tendered under the option or warrant agreement and the resulting discount establishes an effective exercise price below the market price of the ordinary shares obtainable upon exercise. In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, those options or warrants are assumed to be exercised and the debt or other instruments are assumed to be tendered. If tendering cash is more advantageous to the option or warrant holder and the contract permits tendering cash, tendering of cash is assumed. Interest (net of tax) on any debt assumed to be tendered is added back as an adjustment to the numerator.<br>
<br>
A8 Similar treatment is given to preference shares that have similar provisions or to other instruments that have conversion options that permit the investor to pay cash for a more favourable conversion rate.<br>
<br>
A9 The underlying terms of certain options or warrants may require the proceeds received from the exercise of those instruments to be applied to redeem debt or other instruments of the entity (or its parent or a subsidiary). In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, those options or warrants are assumed to be exercised and the proceeds applied to purchase the debt at its average market price rather than to purchase ordinary shares. However, the excess proceeds received from the assumed exercise over the amount used for the assumed purchase of debt are considered (ie assumed to be used to buy back ordinary shares) in the diluted earnings per share calculation. Interest (net of tax) on any debt assumed to be purchased is added back as an adjustment to the numerator.<br>
<br>
<b>Written put options</b><br>
A10 To illustrate the application of paragraph 63, assume that an entity has outstanding 120 written put options on its ordinary shares with an exercise price of Rs. 35. The average market price of its ordinary shares for the period is Rs. 28. In calculating diluted earnings per share, the entity assumes that it issued 150 shares at Rs. 28 per share at the beginning of the period to satisfy its put obligation of Rs. 4,200. The difference between the 150 ordinary shares issued and the 120 ordinary shares received from satisfying the put option (30 incremental ordinary shares) is added to the denominator in calculating diluted earnings per share.<br>
<b><br>
Instruments of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates</b><br>
A11 Potential ordinary shares of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate convertible into either ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate, or ordinary shares of the parent or investors with joint control of, or significant influence (the reporting entity) over, the investee are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as follows:<br>
<br>
(a)	instruments issued by a subsidiary, joint venture or associate that enable their holders to obtain ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate are included in calculating the diluted earnings per share data of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. Those earnings per share are then included in the reporting entity’s earnings per share calculations based on the reporting entity’s holding of the instruments of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate.<br>
<br>
(b)	instruments of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate that are convertible into the reporting entity’s ordinary shares are considered among the potential ordinary shares of the reporting entity for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share. Likewise, options or warrants issued by a subsidiary, joint venture or associate to purchase ordinary shares of the reporting entity are considered among the potential ordinary shares of the reporting entity in the calculation of consolidated diluted earnings per share.<br>
<br>
A12 For the purpose of determining the earnings per share effect of instruments issued by a reporting entity that are convertible into ordinary shares of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the instruments are assumed to be converted and the numerator (profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity) adjusted as necessary in accordance with paragraph 33.<br>
<br>
In addition to those adjustments, the numerator is adjusted for any change in the profit or loss recorded by the reporting entity (such as dividend income or equity method income) that is attributable to the increase in the number of ordinary shares of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate outstanding as a result of the assumed conversion. The denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation is not affected because the number of ordinary shares of the reporting entity outstanding would not change upon assumed conversion.<br>
<br>
<b>Participating equity instruments and two-class ordinary shares</b><br>
A13	The equity of some entities includes:<br>
<br>
(a)	instruments that participate in dividends with ordinary shares according to a predetermined formula (for example, two for one) with, at times, an upper limit on the extent of participation (for example, up to, but not beyond, a specified amount per share).<br>
(b)	a class of ordinary shares with a different dividend rate from that of another class of ordinary shares but without prior or senior rights.<br>
<br>
A14 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, conversion is assumed for those instruments described in paragraph A13 that are convertible into ordinary shares if the effect is dilutive. For those instruments that are not convertible into a class of ordinary shares, profit or loss for the period is allocated to the different classes of shares and participating equity instruments in accordance with their dividend rights or other rights to participate in undistributed earnings. To calculate basic and diluted earnings per share:<br>
<br>
(a)	profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity is adjusted (a profit reduced and a loss increased) by the amount of dividends declared in the period for each class of shares and by the contractual amount of dividends (or interest on participating bonds) that must be paid for the period (for example, unpaid cumulative dividends).<br>
<br>
(b)	the remaining profit or loss is allocated to ordinary shares and participating equity instruments to the extent that each instrument shares in earnings as if all of the profit or loss for the period had been distributed. The total profit or loss allocated to each class of equity instrument is determined by adding together the amount allocated for dividends and the amount allocated for a participation feature.<br>
<br>
(c)	the total amount of profit or loss allocated to each class of equity instrument is divided by the number of outstanding instruments to which the earnings are allocated to determine the earnings per share for the instrument.<br>
<br>
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, all potential ordinary shares assumed to have been issued are included in outstanding ordinary shares.<br>
<br>
<b>Partly paid shares</b><br>
A15 Where ordinary shares are issued but not fully paid, they are treated in the calculation of basic earnings per share as a fraction of an ordinary share to the extent that they were entitled to participate in dividends during the period relative to a  fully paid ordinary share.<br>
<br>
A16 To the extent that partly paid shares are not entitled to participate in dividends during the period they are treated as the equivalent of warrants or options in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. The unpaid balance is assumed to represent proceeds used to purchase ordinary shares. The number of shares included in diluted earnings per share is the difference between the number of shares subscribed and the number of shares assumed to be purchased.<br>
<br>
<b>Appendix 1</b><br>
<br>
Note: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose of this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 33 and the corresponding International Accounting Standard (IAS) 33, Earnings per Share, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.<br>
<br>
Comparison with IAS 33, Earnings per Share<br>
<br>
1	IAS 33 provides that when an entity presents both consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements, it may give EPS related information in consolidated financial statements only, whereas, the Ind AS 33 requires EPS related information to be disclosed both in consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements.<br>
<br>
2	Different terminology is used, as used in existing laws eg, the term ‘Statement of profit and loss’ is used instead of ‘Statement of comprehensive income’. The words ‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead of ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of financial statements considered for the purpose of events after the reporting period.<br>
<br>
3	Paragraph 2 of IAS 33 requires that the entire  standard applies to:<br>
<br>
(a)	the separate or individual financial statements of an entity:<br>
<br>
(i)	whose ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares are traded in a public market (a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and regional markets) or<br>
(ii)	that files, or is in the process of filing, its financial statements with a Securities Regulator or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing ordinary shares in a public market; and<br>
<br>
(b)	the consolidated financial statements of a group with a parent:<br>
<br>
(i)	whose ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares are traded in a public market (a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and regional markets) or<br>
<br>
(ii)	that files, or is in the process of filing, its financial statements with a Securities Regulator or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing ordinary shares in a public market.<br>
<br>
It also requires that an entity that discloses earnings per share shall calculate and disclose earnings per share in accordance with this Standard.<br>
<br>
The above have been deleted in the Ind AS as the applicability or exemptions to theIndASs is governed by the Companies Act and the Rules made thereunder. However, the paragraph number has been retained in Ind AS 33 to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 33.<br>
<br>
4	Paragraph 4 has been modified in Ind AS 33 to clarify that an entity shall not present in separate financial statements, earnings per share based on the information given in consolidated financial statements, besides requiring as in IAS 33, that earnings per share based on the information given in separate financial statements shall not be presented in the consolidated financial statements.<br>
<br>
5	In Ind AS 33, a paragraph has been added after paragraph 12 on the following lines: “Where any item of income or expense which is otherwise required to be recognized in profit or loss in accordance with accounting standards is debited or credited to securities premium account/other reserves, the amount in respect thereof shall be deducted from profit or loss from continuing operations for the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share.”<br>
<br>
6	In Ind AS 33, paragraph 15 has been amended by adding the phrase, ‘irrespective of whether such discount or premium is debited or credited to securities  premium  account in view of requirements of any law’ to further clarify that such discount or premium shall also be amortised to retained earnings.<br>
<br>
7	Requirements regarding disclosure of amounts per share using a reported component, basic and diluted earnings per share and basic and diluted earnings per share for discontinued operations in the separate income statement, where separate income statement is presented under following paragraphs of IAS 33  have been deleted:<br>
(i)	paragraph 4A<br>
(ii)	paragraph 67A<br>
(iii)	paragraph 68A<br>
(iv)	paragraph 73A<br>
This change is consequential to the removal of option regarding the two statement approach in Ind AS 1. Ind AS 1 only requires that the components of profit or loss and components of other comprehensive income shall be presented as a part of the statement of profit and loss. However, paragraph numbers have been retained in Ind AS 33 to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 33.<br>
<br>
8	Paragraph number 25 appears as ‘Deleted’ in IAS 33. In order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 33, the paragraph number is retained in Ind AS 33.</font></p>
