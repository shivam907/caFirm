</i></b><br>
<i>(This Indian Accounting Standard includes paragraphs set in <b>bold</b> type and plain type, which have equal authority. Paragraphs in <b>bold</b> type indicate the main principles.)</i><br>
<br>
<b><u>Objective<br>
</u></b><br>
<b>1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting for  investments in associates and to set out the requirements for the  application of the equity method when accounting for investments in  associates and joint ventures.</b><br>
<br>
<b><u>Scope<br>
</u></b><br>
<b>2 This Standard shall be applied by all entities that are investors  with joint control of, or significant influence over, an investee.<br>
</b><br>
<b><u>Definitions&nbsp;<br>
</u></b><br>
<b>3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:&nbsp;</b></font></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font face="Arial"><font size="2">An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence.<br>
Consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of a  group in which assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash  flows of the parent and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a  single economic entity.<br>
<br>
The equity method is a method of accounting whereby the investment is  initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the  post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of the investee’s net  assets. The investor’s profit or loss includes its share of the  investee’s profit or loss and the investor’s other comprehensive income  includes its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income.<br>
</font></font></b><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><br>
<b>A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control.<br>
</b><br>
<b>Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an  arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant  activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.<br>
</b><br>
<b>A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have  joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the  arrangement.<br>
</b><br>
<b>A joint venturer is a party to a joint venture that has joint control of that joint venture.<br>
<br>
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and  operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint  control of those policies.<br>
</b><br>
4 The following terms are defined in paragraph 4 of Ind AS 27, <i>Separate Financial Statements</i>, and in Appendix A of Ind AS 110, <i>Consolidated Financial Statements</i>, and are used in this Standard with the meanings specified in the Ind ASs in which they are defined:<br>
<br>
• control of an investee<br>
<br>
• group<br>
<br>
• parent<br>
<br>
• separate financial statements<br>
<br>
• subsidiary.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Significant influence&nbsp;<br>
</u></b><br>
5 If an entity holds, directly or indirectly (eg through subsidiaries),  20 per cent or more of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed  that the entity has significant influence, unless it can be clearly  demonstrated that this is not the case. Conversely, if the entity holds,  directly or indirectly (eg through subsidiaries), less than 20 per cent  of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the entity  does not have significant influence, unless such influence can be  clearly demonstrated. A substantial or majority ownership by another  investor does not necessarily preclude an entity from having significant  influence.<br>
<br>
6 The existence of significant influence by an entity is usually evidenced in one or more of the following ways:<br>
<br>
(a) representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee;<br>
<br>
(b) participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions;<br>
<br>
(c) material transactions between the entity and its investee;<br>
<br>
(d) interchange of managerial personnel; or<br>
<br>
(e) provision of essential technical information.<br>
<br>
7 An entity may own share warrants, share call options, debt or equity  instruments that are convertible into ordinary shares, or other similar  instruments that have the potential, if exercised or converted, to give  the entity additional voting power or to reduce another party’s voting  power over the financial and operating policies of another entity (ie  potential voting rights). The existence and effect of potential voting  rights that are currently exercisable or convertible, including  potential voting rights held by other entities, are considered when  assessing whether an entity has significant influence. Potential voting  rights are not currently exercisable or convertible when, for example,  they cannot be exercised or converted until a future date or until the  occurrence of a future event.<br>
<br>
8 In assessing whether potential voting rights contribute to significant  influence, the entity examines all facts and circumstances (including  the terms of exercise of the potential voting rights and any other  contractual arrangements whether considered individually or in  combination) that affect potential rights, except the intentions of  management and the financial ability to exercise or convert those  potential rights.<br>
<br>
9 An entity loses significant influence over an investee when it loses  the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions  of that investee. The loss of significant influence can occur with or  without a change in absolute or relative ownership levels. It could  occur, for example, when an associate becomes subject to the control of a  government, court, administrator or regulator. It could also occur as a  result of a contractual arrangement.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Equity method&nbsp;<br>
</u></b><br>
10 Under the equity method, on initial recognition the investment in an  associate or a joint venture is recognised at cost, and the carrying  amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of  the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The  investor’s share of the investee’s profit or loss is recognised in the  investor’s profit or loss. Distributions received from an investee  reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Adjustments to the  carrying amount may also be necessary for changes in the investor’s  proportionate interest in the investee arising from changes in the  investee’s other comprehensive income. Such changes include those  arising from the revaluation of property, plant and equipment and from  foreign exchange translation differences. The investor’s share of those  changes is recognised in the investor’s other comprehensive income (see  Ind AS 1,<i> Presentation of Financial Statements</i>).<br>
<br>
11 The recognition of income on the basis of distributions received may  not be an adequate measure of the income earned by an investor on an  investment in an associate or a joint venture because the distributions  received may bear little relation to the performance of the associate or  joint venture. Because the investor has joint control of, or  significant influence over, the investee, the investor has an interest  in the associate’s or joint venture’s performance and, as a result, the  return on its investment. The investor accounts for this interest by  extending the scope of its financial statements to include its share of  the profit or loss of such an investee. As a result, application of the  equity method provides more informative reporting of the investor’s net  assets and profit or loss.<br>
<br>
12 When potential voting rights or other derivatives containing  potential voting rights exist, an entity’s interest in an associate or a  joint venture is determined solely on the basis of existing ownership  interests and does not reflect the possible exercise or conversion of  potential voting rights and other derivative instruments, unless  paragraph 13 applies.<br>
<br>
13 In some circumstances, an entity has, in substance, an existing  ownership as a result of a transaction that currently gives it access to  the returns associated with an ownership interest. In such  circumstances, the proportion allocated to the entity is determined by  taking into account the eventual exercise of those potential voting  rights and other derivative instruments that currently give the entity  access to the returns.<br>
<br>
14 Ind AS 109, <i>Financial Instruments, </i>does not apply to interests  in associates and joint ventures that are accounted for using the  equity method. When instruments containing potential voting rights in  substance currently give access to the returns associated with an  ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture, the instruments  are not subject to Ind AS<br>
109. In all other cases, instruments containing potential voting rights  in an associate or a joint venture are accounted for in accordance with  Ind AS 109.<br>
<br>
15 Unless an investment, or a portion of an investment, in an associate  or a joint venture is classified as held for sale in accordance with Ind  AS 105, <i>Non-current Assets Held for Sale</i> <i>and Discontinued Operations</i>,  the investment, or any retained interest in the investment not  classified as held for sale, shall be classified as a non-current asset.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Application of the equity method&nbsp;<br>
</u></b><br>
16 An entity with joint control of, or significant influence over, an  investee shall account for its investment in an associate or a joint  venture using the equity method except when that investment qualifies  for exemption in accordance with paragraphs 17–19.<br>
<br>
<b>Exemptions from applying the equity method<br>
</b><br>
17 An entity need not apply the equity method to its investment in an  associate or a joint venture if the entity is a parent that is exempt  from preparing consolidated financial statements by the scope exception  in paragraph 4(a) of Ind AS 110 or if all the following apply:<br>
<br>
(a) The entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary, or is a partially-owned  subsidiary of another entity and its other owners, including those not  otherwise entitled to vote, have been informed about, and do not object  to, the entity not applying the equity method.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial">(b) The  entity’s debt or equity instruments are not traded in a public market (a  domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market,  including local and regional markets).</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial">(c) The  entity did not file, nor is it in the process of filing, its financial  statements with a securities commission or other regulatory  organisation, for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in a  public market.<br>

An entity shall make this election separately for each associate or joint venture, at initial recognition of the associate or joint venture.]</font></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;">
</font><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;19 When an entity has an investment in an associate, a portion of which  is held indirectly through a venture capital organisation, or a mutual  fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked  insurance funds, the entity may elect to measure that portion of the  investment in the associate at fair value through profit or loss in  accordance with Ind AS 109 regardless of whether the venture capital  organisation has significant influence over that portion of the  investment. If the entity makes that election, the entity shall apply  the equity method to any remaining portion of its investment in an  associate that is not held through a venture capital organisation.<br>
<br>
<b>Classification as held for sale<br>
</b><br>
20 An entity shall apply Ind AS 105 to an investment, or a portion of an  investment, in an associate or a joint venture that meets the criteria  to be classified as held for sale. Any retained portion of an investment  in an associate or a joint venture that has not been classified as held  for sale shall be accounted for using the equity method until disposal  of the portion that is classified as held for sale takes place. After  the disposal takes place, an entity shall account for any retained  interest in the associate or joint venture in accordance with Ind AS 109  unless the retained interest continues to be an associate or a joint  venture, in which case the entity uses the equity method.<br>
<br>
21 When an investment, or a portion of an investment, in an associate or  a joint venture previously classified as held for sale no longer meets  the criteria to be so classified, it shall be accounted for using the  equity method retrospectively as from the date of its classification as  held for sale. Financial statements for the periods since classification  as held for sale shall be amended accordingly.<br>
<br>
<b>Discontinuing the use of the equity method</b><br>
<br>
<b>22 An entity shall discontinue the use of the equity method from the  date when its investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture as  follows:<br>
<br>
(a) If the investment becomes a subsidiary, the entity shall account for  its investment in accordance with Ind AS 103, Business Combinations,  and Ind AS 110.<br>
<br>
(b) If the retained interest in the former associate or joint venture is  a financial asset, the entity shall measure the retained interest at  fair value. The fair value of the retained interest shall be regarded as  its fair value on initial recognition as a financial asset in  accordance with Ind AS 109. The entity shall recognise in profit or loss  any difference between:<br>
<br>
(i) the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from  disposing of a part interest in the associate or joint venture; and<br>
<br>
(ii) the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method was discontinued.<br>
<br>
(c) When an entity discontinues the use of the equity method, the entity  shall account for all amounts previously recognised in other  comprehensive income in relation to that investment on the same basis as  would have been required if the investee had directly disposed of the  related assets or liabilities.<br>
</b><br>
23 Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognised in other  comprehensive income by the investee would be reclassified to profit or  loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the entity  reclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss (as a  reclassification adjustment) when the equity method is discontinued. For  example, if an associate or a joint venture has cumulative exchange  differences relating to a foreign operation and the entity discontinues  the use of the equity method, the entity shall reclassify to profit or  loss the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other  comprehensive income in relation to the foreign operation.<br>
<br>
<b>24 If an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a joint  venture or an investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an  associate, the entity continues to apply the equity method and does not  remeasure the retained interest.</b><br>
<br>
Changes in ownership interest<br>
<br>
25 If an entity’s ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture  is reduced, but the entity continues to apply the equity method, the  entity shall reclassify to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or  loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income  relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss  would be required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal  of the related assets or liabilities.<br>
<br>
<b>Equity method procedures<br>
</b><br>
26 Many of the procedures that are appropriate for the application of  the equity method are similar to the consolidation procedures described  in Ind AS 110. Furthermore, the concepts underlying the procedures used  in accounting for the acquisition of a subsidiary are also adopted in  accounting for the acquisition of an investment in an associate or a  joint venture.<br>
<br>
<sup><font color="#993300"><span title="Substituted by Notification Dated 30th March, 2016."><a href="#MCAb">b</a></span></font></sup><font color="#993300">[27  A group’s share in an associate or a joint venture is the aggregate of  the holdings in that associate or joint venture by the parent and its  subsidiaries. The holdings of the group’s other associates or joint  ventures are ignored for this purpose. When an associate or a joint  venture has subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, the profit or  loss, other comprehensive income and net assets taken into account in  applying the equity method are those recognised in the associate’s or  joint venture’s financial statements (including the associate’s or joint  venture’s share of the profit or loss, other comprehensive income and  net assets of its associates and joint ventures), after any adjustments  necessary to give effect to uniform accounting policies (see paragraphs  35–36A).]</font><br>
<br>
28 Gains and losses resulting from ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’  transactions between an entity (including its consolidated subsidiaries)  and its associate or joint venture are recognised in the entity’s  financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors’  interests in the associate or joint venture. ‘Upstream’ transactions  are, for example, sales of assets from an associate or a joint venture  to the investor. ‘Downstream’ transactions are, for example, sales or  contributions of assets from the investor to its associate or its joint  venture. The investor’s share in the associate’s or joint venture’s  gains or losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated.<br>
<br>
29 When downstream transactions provide evidence of a reduction in the  net realisable value of the assets to be sold or contributed, or of an  impairment loss of those assets, those losses shall be recognised in  full by the investor. When upstream transactions provide evidence of a  reduction in the net realisable value of the assets to be purchased or  of an impairment loss of those assets, the investor shall recognise its  share in those losses.<br>
<br>
30 The contribution of a non-monetary asset to an associate or a joint  venture in exchange for an equity interest in the associate or joint  venture shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph 28, except  when the contribution lacks commercial substance, as that term is  described in Ind AS 16, <i>Property, Plant and Equipment</i>. If such a  contribution lacks commercial substance, the gain or loss is regarded as  unrealised and is not recognised unless paragraph 31 also applies. Such  unrealised gains and losses shall be eliminated against the investment  accounted for using the equity method and shall not be presented as  deferred gains or losses in the entity’s consolidated balance sheet or  in the entity’s balance sheet in which investments are accounted for  using the equity method.<br>
<br>
31 If, in addition to receiving an equity interest in an associate or a  joint venture, an entity receives monetary or non-monetary assets, the  entity recognises in full in profit or loss the portion of the gain or  loss on the non-monetary contribution relating to the monetary or non-  monetary assets received.<br>
<br>
32 An investment is accounted for using the equity method from the date  on which it becomes an associate or a joint venture. On acquisition of  the investment, any difference between the cost of the investment and  the entity’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable  assets and liabilities is accounted for as follows:<br>
<br>
(a) Goodwill relating to an associate or a joint venture is included in  the carrying amount of the investment. Amortisation of that goodwill is  not permitted.<br>
<br>
(b) Any excess of the entity’s share of the net fair value of the  investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the  investment is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve in the  period in which the investment is acquired.<br>
<br>
Appropriate adjustments to the entity’s share of the associate’s or  joint venture’s profit or loss after acquisition are made in order to  account, for example, for depreciation of the depreciable assets based  on their fair values at the acquisition date. Similarly, appropriate  adjustments to the entity’s share of the associate’s or joint venture’s  profit or loss after acquisition are made for impairment losses such as  for goodwill or property, plant and equipment.<br>
<br>
<b>33 The most recent available financial statements of the associate or  joint venture are used by the entity in applying the equity method.  When the end of the reporting period of the entity is different from  that of the associate or joint venture, the associate or joint venture  prepares, for the use of the entity, financial statements as of the same  date as the financial statements of the entity unless it is  impracticable to do so.</b><br>
<br>
<b>34 When, in accordance with paragraph 33, the financial statements of  an associate or a joint venture used in applying the equity method are  prepared as of a date different from that used by the entity,  adjustments shall be made for the effects of significant transactions or  events that occur between that date and the date of the entity’s  financial statements. In any case, the difference between the end of the  reporting period of the associate or joint venture and that of the  entity shall be no more than three months. The length of the reporting  periods and any difference between the ends of the reporting periods  shall be the same from period to period.<br>
<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="2" face="Arial"> 37 If an associate or a joint venture has outstanding cumulative  preference shares that are held by parties other than the entity and are  classified as equity, the entity computes its share of profit or loss  after adjusting for the dividends on such shares, whether or not the  dividends have been declared.<br>
<br>
38 If an entity’s share of losses of an associate or a joint venture  equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, the  entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses. The  interest in an associate or a joint venture is the carrying amount of  the investment in the associate or joint venture determined using the  equity method together with any long-term interests that, in substance,  form part of the entity’s net investment in the associate or joint  venture. For example, an item for which settlement is neither planned  nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, an  extension of the entity’s investment in that associate or joint venture.  Such items may include preference shares and long-term receivables or  loans, but do not include trade receivables, trade payables or any  long-term receivables for which adequate collateral exists, such as  secured loans. Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of  the entity’s investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other  components of the entity’s interest in an associate or a joint venture  in the reverse order of their seniority (ie priority in liquidation).<br>
<br>
39 After the entity’s interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are  provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that  the entity has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made  payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. If the associate  or joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes  recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the  profits equals the share of losses not recognised.<br>
<br>
<b>Impairment losses<br>
</b><br>
40 After application of the equity method, including recognising the  associate’s or joint venture’s losses in accordance with paragraph 38,  the entity applies paragraphs 41A-41Cto determine whether it isany  objective evidence that its net investment in the associate or joint  venture is impaired.<br>
<br>
41 The entity applies the impairment requirements in Ind AS 109 to its  other interests in the associate or joint venture that are in the scope  of Ind AS 109 and that do not constitute a part of the net investment.<br>
<br>
41A&nbsp; The net investment in an associate or joint venture is impaired and  impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective  evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred  after the initial recognition of the net investment (a ‘loss event’) and  that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash  flows from the net investment that can be reliably estimated. It may not  be possible to identify a single, discrete event that caused the  impairment. Rather the combined effect of several events may have caused  the impairment. Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter  how likely, are not recognised. Objective evidence that the net  investment is impaired includes observable data that comes to the  attention of the entity about the following loss events:<br>
<br>
(a) significant financial difficulty of the associate or joint venture;<br>
<br>
(b) a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in payments by the associate or joint venture;<br>
<br>
(c) the entity, for economic or legal reasons relating to its  associate’s or joint venture’s financial difficulty, granting to the  associate or joint venture a concession that the entity would not  otherwise consider;<br>
<br>
(d) it becoming probable that the associate or joint venture will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or<br>
<br>
(e) the disappearance of an active market for the net investment because  of financial difficulties of the associate or joint venture.<br>
<br>
41B&nbsp; The disappearance of an active market because the associate’s or  joint venture’s equity or financial instruments are no longer publicly  traded is not evidence of impairment. A downgrade of an associate’s or  joint venture’s credit rating or a decline in the fair value of the  associate or joint venture, is not of itself, evidence of impairment,  although it may be evidence of impairment when considered with other  available information.<br>
<br>
41C&nbsp; In addition to the types of events in paragraph 41A, objective  evidence of impairment for the net investment in the equity instruments  of the associate or joint venture includes information about significant  changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the  technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the  associate or joint venture operates, and indicates that the cost of the  investment in the equity instrument may not be recovered. A significant  or prolonged decline in the fair value of an investment in an equity  instrument below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment.<br>
<br>
42 Because goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of the net  investment in an associate or a joint venture is not separately  recognised, it is not tested for impairment separately by applying the  requirements for impairment testing goodwill in Ind AS 36, Impairment of  Assets. Instead, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested  for impairment in accordance with Ind AS 36 as a single asset, by  comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value  less costs to sell) with its carrying amount, whenever application of  paragraphs 41A-41C indicates that the net investment may be impaired. An  impairment loss recognised in those circumstances is not allocated to  any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of  the net investment in the associate or joint venture. Accordingly, any  reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with Ind AS  36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the net investment  subsequently increases. In determining the value in use of the net  investment, an entity estimates:<br>
<br>
(a) its share of the present value of the estimated future cash flows  expected to be generated by the associate or joint venture, including  the cash flows from the operations of the associate or joint venture and  the proceeds from the ultimate disposal of the investment; or<br>
<br>
(b) the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to  arise from dividends to be received from the investment and from its  ultimate disposal.<br>
<br>
Using appropriate assumptions, both methods give the same result.<br>
<br>
43 The recoverable amount of an investment in an associate or a joint  venture shall be assessed for each associate or joint venture, unless  the associate or joint venture does not generate cash inflows from  continuing use that are largely independent of those from other assets  of the entity.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Separate financial statements<br>
</u></b><br>
44 An investment in an associate or a joint venture shall be accounted  for in the entity’s separate financial statements in accordance with  paragraph 10 of Ind AS 27.</font></p>

<b>Appendix 1</b></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">Note:  This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The  purpose of this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if  any, between Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 28, Investments in  Associates and Joint Ventures, and the corresponding International  Accounting Standard (IAS) 28, Investments in Associates and Joint  Ventures, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.</font></i><font size="2"><br>
<br>
<b>Comparison with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures<br>
</b>1. Paragraph 35 of Ind AS 28 requires use of uniform accounting  policies, unless, in case of an associate, it is impracticable, which  IAS 28 does not provide. This change has been made because the investor  does not have ‘control’ over the associate, it may not be able to  influence the associate to prepare additional financial statements or to  follow the accounting policies that are followed by the investor.<br>
<br>
2. Paragraph 32 (b) has been modified on the lines of Ind AS 103,  Business Combinations, to transfer excess of the investor’s share of the  net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities  over the cost of investment in capital reserve whereas in IAS 28, it is  recognised in profit or loss.<br>
<br>
3. Different terminology is used, as used in existing laws, eg, the term  ‘balance sheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’.</font></font></p>
