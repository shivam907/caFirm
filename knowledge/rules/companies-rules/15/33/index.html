These exceptions are set out in paragraphs 14–17 and Appendix B.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Estimates<br><br>14 An entity’s estimates in accordance with Ind ASs at the date of transition to Ind ASs shall be consistent with estimates made for the same date in accordance with previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any difference in accounting policies), unless there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error.</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>15 An entity may receive information after the date of transition to Ind ASs about estimates that it had made under previous GAAP. In accordance with paragraph 14, an entity shall treat the receipt of that information in the same way as non-adjusting events after the reporting period in accordance with Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period. For example, assume that an entity’s date of transition to Ind ASs is 1 April 2015 and new information on 15 July 2015 requires the revision of an estimate made in accordance with previous GAAP at 31 March 2015. The entity shall not reflect that new information in its opening Ind AS Balance Sheet (unless the estimates need adjustment for any differences in accounting policies or there is objective evidence that the estimates were in error). Instead, the entity shall reflect that new information in profit or loss (or, if appropriate, other comprehensive income) for the year ended 31 March 2016.<br><br>16 An entity may need to make estimates in accordance with Ind ASs at the date of transition to Ind ASs that were not required at that date under previous GAAP. To achieve consistency with Ind AS 10, those estimates in accordance with Ind ASs shall reflect conditions that existed at the date of transition to Ind ASs. In particular, estimates at the date of transition to Ind ASs of market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates shall reflect market conditions at that date.<br><br>17 Paragraphs 14–16 apply to the opening Ind AS Balance Sheet. They also apply to a comparative period presented in an entity’s first Ind AS financial statements, in which case the references to the date of transition to Ind ASs are replaced by references to the end of that comparative period.<br><br></span><span class="cs5E98E930">Exemptions from other Ind ASs</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>18 An entity may elect to use one or more of the exemptions contained in Appendices C-D.

This Ind AS does not require such summaries to comply with the recognition and measurement requirements of Ind ASs. Furthermore, some entities present comparative information in accordance with previous GAAP as well as the comparative information required by Ind AS 1. In any financial statements containing historical summaries or comparative information in accordance with previous GAAP, an entity shall:<br><br>(a) label the previous GAAP information prominently as not being prepared in accordance with Ind ASs; and<br><br>(b) disclose the nature of the main adjustments that would make it comply with Ind ASs.

An entity shall apply the following requirements to business combinations that the entity recognised before the date of transition to Ind ASs. This Appendix should only be applied to business combinations within the scope of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations.<br><br>C1 A first-time adopter may elect not to apply Ind AS 103 retrospectively to past business combinations (business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to Ind ASs). However, if a first-time adopter restates any business combination to comply with Ind AS 103, it shall restate all later business combinations and shall also apply Ind AS 110 from that same date. For example, if a first-time adopter elects to restate a business combination that occurred on 30 June 2010, it shall restate all business combinations that occurred between 30 June 2010 and the date of transition to Ind ASs, and it shall also apply Ind AS 110 from 30 June 2010.<br><br>C2 An entity need not apply Ind AS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to Ind ASs. If the entity does not apply Ind AS 21 retrospectively to those fair value adjustments and goodwill, it shall treat them as assets and liabilities of the entity rather than as assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Therefore, those goodwill and fair value adjustments either are already expressed in the entity’s functional currency or are non-monetary foreign currency items, which are reported using the exchange rate applied in accordance with previous GAAP.<br><br>C3 An entity may apply Ind AS 21 retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill arising in either:<br><br>(a) all business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to Ind ASs; or<br><br>(b) all business combinations that the entity elects to restate to comply with Ind AS 103, as permitted by paragraph C1 above.<br><br>C4 If a first-time adopter does not apply Ind AS 103 retrospectively to a past business combination, this has the following consequences for that business combination:<br><br>(a) The first-time adopter shall keep the same classification (as an acquisition by the legal acquirer, a reverse acquisition by the legal acquiree, or a uniting of interests) as in its previous GAAP financial statements.<br><br>(b) The first-time adopter shall recognise all its assets and liabilities at the date of transition to Ind ASs that were acquired or assumed in a past business combination, other than:<br><br>(i) some financial assets and financial liabilities derecognised in accordance with previous GAAP (see paragraph B2); and<br><br>(ii) assets, including goodwill, and liabilities that were not recognised in the acquirer’s consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with previous GAAP and also would not qualify for recognition in accordance with Ind ASs in the separate Balance Sheet of the acquiree (see (f)–(i) below).<br><br>The first-time adopter shall recognise any resulting change by adjusting retained earnings (or, if appropriate, another category of equity), unless the change results from the recognition of an intangible asset that was previously subsumed within goodwill (see (g)(i) below).<br><br>(c) The first-time adopter shall exclude from its opening Ind AS Balance Sheet any item recognised in accordance with previous GAAP that does not qualify for recognition as an asset or liability under Ind ASs. The first-time adopter shall account for the resulting change as follows:<br><br>(i) the first-time adopter may have classified a past business combination as an acquisition and recognised as an intangible asset an item that does not qualify for recognition as an asset in accordance with Ind AS 38, Intangible Assets. It shall reclassify that item (and, if any, the related deferred tax and non- controlling interests) as part of goodwill (unless it deducted goodwill directly from equity in accordance with previous GAAP, see (g)(i) and (i) below) or capital reserve to the extent not exceeding the balance available in that reserve.<br><br>(ii) the first-time adopter shall recognise all other resulting changes in retained earnings.</span><span class="cs5E98E930">1</span><span class="csA16174BA"><br><br>(d) Ind ASs require subsequent measurement of some assets and liabilities on a basis that is not based on original cost, such as fair value. The first-time adopter shall measure these assets and liabilities on that basis in its opening Ind AS Balance Sheet, even if they were acquired or assumed in a past business combination. It shall recognise any resulting change in the carrying amount by adjusting retained earnings (or, if appropriate, another category of equity), rather than goodwill/capital reserve.<br><br>(e) Immediately after the business combination, the carrying amount in accordance with previous GAAP of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in that business combination shall be their deemed cost in accordance with Ind ASs at that date. If Ind ASs require a cost-based measurement of those assets and liabilities at a later date that deemed cost shall be the basis for cost-based depreciation or amortisation from the date of the business combination.<br><br></span><span class="cs1996077C"><a class="csEC80D8B8" href="#MCAs"><span class="cs48129E1B">s</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">[(f)If an asset acquired, or liability assumed, in a past business combination was not recognised in accordance with previous GAAP, it does not have a deemed cost of zero in the opening Ind AS Balance Sheet.

To illustrate: if the acquirer had not, in accordance with its previous GAAP, capitalised leases acquired in a past business combination in which acquiree was a lessee, it shall capitalise those leases in its consolidated financial statements, as Ind AS 116, Leases, would require the acquiree to do in its Ind AS Balance Sheet. Similarly, if the acquirer had not, in accordance with its previous GAAP, recognised a contingent liability that still exists at the date of transition to Ind ASs, the acquirer shall recognise that contingent liability at that date unless Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, would prohibit its recognition in the financial statements of the acquiree. Conversely, if an asset or liability was subsumed in goodwill/capital reserve in accordance with previous GAAP but would have been recognised separately under Ind AS 103, that asset or liability remains in goodwill/capital reserve unless Ind ASs would require its recognition in the financial statements of the acquiree.]</span></p><p class="cs1295A19"><span class="csA16174BA"><br>(g) The carrying amount of goodwill or capital reserve in the opening Ind AS Balance Sheet shall be its carrying amount in accordance with previous GAAP at the date of transition to Ind ASs, after the following two adjustments:<br><br>(i) If required by (c)(i) above, the first-time adopter shall increase the carrying amount of goodwill or decrease the carrying amount of capital reserve when it reclassifies an item that it recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with previous GAAP. Similarly, if (f) above requires the first-time adopter to recognise an intangible asset that was subsumed in recognised goodwill or capital reserve in accordance with previous GAAP, the first-time adopter shall decrease the carrying amount of<br>goodwill or increase the carrying amount of capital reserve accordingly (and, if applicable, adjust deferred tax and non- controlling interests).<br><br>(ii) Regardless of whether there is any indication that the goodwill may be impaired, the first-time adopter shall apply Ind AS 36 in testing the goodwill for impairment at the date of transition to Ind ASs and in recognising any resulting impairment loss in retained earnings (or, if so required by Ind AS 36, in revaluation surplus). The impairment test shall be based on conditions at the date of transition to Ind ASs.<br><br>(h) No other adjustments shall be made to the carrying amount of goodwill / capital reserve at the date of transition to Ind ASs. For example, the first-time adopter shall not restate the carrying amount of goodwill / capital reserve:<br><br>(i) to exclude in-process research and development acquired in that business combination (unless the related intangible asset would qualify for recognition in accordance with Ind AS 38 in the Balance Sheet of the acquiree);<br><br>(ii) to adjust previous amortisation of goodwill;<br><br>(iii) to reverse adjustments to goodwill that Ind AS 103 would not permit, but were made in accordance with previous GAAP because of adjustments to assets and liabilities between the date of the business combination and the date of transition to Ind ASs.<br><br>(i) If the first-time adopter recognised goodwill in accordance with previous GAAP as a deduction from equity:<br><br>(i) it shall not recognise that goodwill in its opening Ind AS Balance Sheet. Furthermore, it shall not reclassify that goodwill to profit or loss if it disposes of the subsidiary or if the investment in the subsidiary becomes impaired.<br><br>(ii) adjustments resulting from the subsequent resolution of a contingency affecting the purchase consideration shall be recognised in retained earnings.<br><br>(j) In accordance with its previous GAAP, the first-time adopter may not have consolidated a subsidiary acquired in a past business combination (for example, because the parent did not regard it as a subsidiary in accordance with previous GAAP or did not prepare consolidated financial statements). The first-time adopter shall adjust the carrying amounts of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities to the amounts that Ind ASs would require in the subsidiary’s Balance Sheet. The deemed cost of goodwill equals the difference at the date of transition to Ind ASs between:<br><br>(i) the parent’s interest in those adjusted carrying amounts; and<br><br>(ii) the cost in the parent’s separate financial statements of its investment in the subsidiary.<br><br>(k) The measurement of non-controlling interests and deferred tax follows from the measurement of other assets and liabilities. Therefore, the above adjustments to recognised assets and liabilities affect non-controlling interests and deferred tax.<br><br>C5 The exemption for past business combinations also applies to past acquisitions of investments in associates, interests in joint ventures and interests in joint operations in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, as defined in Ind AS 103 .

Paragraph 3 of Ind AS 101 specifies that an entity’s first Ind AS financial statements are the first annual financial statements in which the entity adopts Ind ASs in accordance with Ind ASs notified under the Companies Act, 2013 whereas IFRS 1 provides various examples of first IFRS financial statements.<br><br>2. Paragraph 4, 4A, 4B, 23A and 23B of IFRS 1 provide various examples of instances when an entity does not apply this IFRS. Ind AS 101 does not provide the same. In order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IFRS 1, the paragraph number is retained in Ind AS 101.<br><br>3. IFRS 1 defines previous GAAP as the basis of accounting that a first-time adopter used immediately before adopting IFRS. However, Ind AS 101 defines previous GAAP as the basis of accounting that a first-time adopter used for its reporting requirement in India immediately before adopting Ind AS.<br><br>The change makes it mandatory for Indian entities to consider the financial statements prepared in accordance with existing notified Indian accounting standards as was applicable to them as previous GAAP when it transitions to Ind ASs.<br><br>4. Under IFRS 1, para C4(c) requires, the first-time adopter shall exclude from its opening Ind AS Balance Sheet any item recognised in accordance with previous GAAP that does not qualify for recognition as an asset or liability under Ind ASs. The first-time adopter shall account for the resulting change in the retained earnings as at the transition date except in certain specific instances where it requires adjustment in the goodwill. In such specific instances where IFRS 1 allows adjustment in the goodwill, under Ind AS 101 it can be adjusted with the Capital reserve to the extent such adjustment amount does not exceed the balance available in Capital reserve.<br><br>5. Ind AS 101 in addition to exemptions provided under IFRS 1, also provides certain optional exemptions relating to the long-term foreign currency monetary items and service concession arrangements relating to toll roads. Accordingly, paragraphs 6 and D22 have been modified. Further a heading and paragraph D13AA have been added after paragraph D13.<br><br>6. Certain IFRS 1 exceptions to the retrospective application of other IFRS refer to transitional provisions of other IFRSs. However Ind ASs does not provide transitional provisions, accordingly transitional provisions in other IFRSs have been incorporated in the paragraphs B8A, B8B, B8D, B8E, B8EA and B8EB of Ind AS 101.<br><br>7. Certain exemptions in Appendix D of IFRS 1 refer to transitional provisions of other IFRSs. However Ind ASs do not provide transitional provisions, accordingly wherever considered an appropriate transitional provision in other IFRSs has been incorporated in the respective exemptions in Appendix D of Ind AS 101. The following paragraphs in IFRS 1 provide the transitional provisions of other IFRSs which are included in Ind AS 101:<br><br>(i) Paragraph D4 includes the transitional provisions of IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts;<br><br></span><span class="csA16174BA"><sup></sup></span><a class="csAC6AF41D" href="#standard101_al"><span class="cs48129E1B"><sup>a</sup></span><span class="cs48129E1B"><sup>l</sup></span></a><span class="csA16174BA">[(</span><span class="cs82E10CDE">ii) Paragraph D9 includes the transitional provisions of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease;</span><span class="csA16174BA">]<br><br>(iii) Paragraph D22 includes the transitional provisions of IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements;<br><br>(iv) Paragraph D25 includes the transitional provisions of IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments;<br><br>(v) Paragraph D31 includes the transitional provisions of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements;<br><br>(vi) Paragraph D32 includes the transitional provisions of IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine; and<br><br>(vii) Paragraph D34 and D35 includes the transitional provisions of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts customer.<br><br>8. IFRS 1 provides for various optional exemptions that an entity can seek while an entity transitions to IFRS from its previous GAAP. Similar provisions have been retained under Ind AS 101. However, there are few changes that have been made, which can be broadly categorized as follows:<br><br>(a) Elimination of effective dates prior to transition date to Ind ASs. IFRS 1 provides for various dates from which a standard could have been implemented. For example,&nbsp;<br><br>Paragraph D2 of IFRS 1 provides that an entity is encouraged, but not required, to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to equity instruments that were granted on or before 7 November 2002 or to instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and vested before the later of (a) the date of transition to IFRSs and (b) 1 January 2005. However, for Ind AS 101 purposes, all these dates have been changed to coincide with the transition date elected by the entity adopting these converged standards i.e. Ind AS.<br><br>(b) Deletion of borrowing cost exemptions not relevant for India:<br><br>Paragraph D23 of IFRS 1 provides for transitional adjustment requiring companies to apply the provisions of IAS 23 prospectively after the transition date to IFRS. However, this was considered as not relevant in Indian situation as AS 16 always required an entity to capitalize borrowing costs as compared to IAS 23 where it provided an option to expense out such borrowing cost.<br><br>(c) Inclusion/modification of existing exemptions to make it relevant for India. For example,<br><br>1. Paragraph D7AA has been added to provide for transitional relief from the retrospective application of Ind AS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment. Paragraph D7AA, provides an entity option to use carrying values of all such assets as on the date of transition to Ind ASs, in accordance with previous GAAP as an acceptable starting point under Ind AS. Paragraph 27AA has been included in Ind AS 101 which requires the disclosure that if an entity adopts for first time exemption the option provided in accordance with paragraph D7AA, the fact and the accounting policy shall be disclosed by the entity until such time that those items of property, plant and equipment, investment properties or intangible assets, as the case maybe, are significantly depreciated, impaired or derecognised from the entity’s Balance Sheet.<br><br>2. Paragraph D9AA has been added to provide for transitional relief while applying Ind AS 17: Leases. D9AA provides an entity to use the transition date facts and circumstances for lease arrangements which includes both land and building elements to assess the classification of each element as finance or an operating lease at the transition date to Ind ASs. Also, if there is any land lease newly classified as finance lease then the first time adopter may recognise assets and liability at fair value on that date; any difference between those fair values is recognised in retained earnings.<br><br>3. Paragraph D35AA has been added to provide for transitional relief while applying Ind AS 105 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Paragraph D35AA provides an entity to use the transitional date circumstances to measure such assets or operations at the lower of carrying value and fair value less cost to sell.<br><br></span><span class="cs1996077C"><a class="csEC80D8B8" href="#MCAac"><span class="cs48129E1B">ac</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">[9.Paragraphs E1-E2 of Appendix E of IFRS 1 provides ‘Short-term exemptions from IFRSs’, however Ind AS 101 does not provide the aforesaid short-term exemptions.

Conversely, if an asset or liability was subsumed in goodwill/capital reserve in accordance with previous GAAP but would have been recognised separately under Ind AS 103, that asset or liability remains in goodwill/capital reserve unless Ind ASs would require its recognition in the financial statements of the acquiree."</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="csD9152503">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="csD9152503">t. <a class="cs8B52A05E" href="http://www.webtel.in/Image/RuleIndAsEng_30032019 (1).pdf"><span class="cs48129E1B">Substituted by&nbsp;the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 dated 30.03.2019</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csA16174BA">Amendment is Effective from 1st April 2019</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="cs1996077C">In Appendix D, in paragraph D1, for item (d)</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="csD9152503">leases (paragraphs D9 and D9AA);</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="cs1996077C">the&nbsp;following item shall be substituted namely;-</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="cs1996077C">"leases (paragraphs D9, D9AA and D9B-D9E)"</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="csD9152503">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="csD9152503">u. </span><span class="cs25A8605A"><a class="cs8E0595FA" href="http://www.webtel.in/Image/RuleIndAsEng_30032019 (1).pdf"><span class="cs48129E1B">Inserted by&nbsp;the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 dated 30.03.2019</span></a></span><span class="cs25A8605A">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csA16174BA">Amendment is Effective from 1st April 2019</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="csD9152503">v. <a class="cs8B52A05E" href="http://www.webtel.in/Image/RuleIndAsEng_30032019 (1).pdf"><span class="cs48129E1B">Substituted by&nbsp;the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 dated 30.03.2019</span></a></span><span class="cs1996077C">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csD9152503">Amendment is Effective from 1st April 2019</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="cs1996077C">for paragraph D8B,</span></p><p class="cs9224F58F"><span class="csD9152503">D8B Some entities hold items of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets that are used, or were previously used, in operations subject to rate&nbsp;regulation.
