(i) The Board may, from time to time, make calls upon the               members in respect of any monies unpaid on their shares (whether               on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of               premium) and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made               payable at fixed times:

              <br/>
              (ii) Each member shall, subject to receiving at least fourteen               days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment,               pay to the company, at the time or times and place so specified,               the amount called on his shares.

              <br/>

              80. The company in general meeting may declare dividends, but               no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the Board.

              the Board may from time to time pay to the members such               interim dividends as appear to it to be justified by the profits               of the company.
              <br/>
              82. (i) The Board may, before recommending any dividend, set aside               out of the profits of the company such sums as it thinks fit as a               reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Board,               be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the company               may be properly applied, including provision for meeting               contingencies or for equalising dividends; and pending such               application, may, at the like discretion, either be employed in               the business of the company or be invested in such investments               (other than shares of the company) as the Board may, from time to               time, thinks fit.

              (ii) The Board may also carry forward any profits which it may               consider necessary not to divide, without setting them aside as a               reserve.

              83. (i) Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to               shares with special rights as to dividends, all dividends shall be               declared and paid according to the amounts paid or credited as               paid on the shares in respect whereof the dividend is paid, but if               and so long as nothing is paid upon any of the shares in the               company, dividends may be declared and paid according to the               amounts of the shares.
              <br/>
              (ii) No amount paid or credited as paid on a share in advance of               calls shall be treated for the purposes of this regulation as paid               on the share.
